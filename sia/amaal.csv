1,Yaa Man Arjoho Le Kulle Khair,"The following du`a is recommended after the daily obligatory prayers in the month of Rajab. The du`a, according to Shaykh `Abbas Qummi in Mafateehul Jinaan has been taught by Imam Ja`far as-Sadiq (a). Sayyid Ibn Tawus has narrated that Muhammad ibn Dhakwan—known as ‘al-Sajjad’ due to his remarkable, long prostration during which he used to weep so heavily that he lost his sight—asked Imam Ja`far al-Sadiq (a.s), saying, “May Allah accept me as ransom for you! We are now in Rajab;  please  teach me a supplication due to which Almighty Allah may help me.” Hence, the Imam (a.s) asked him to write down the following dua:","O Allah, bless Muhammad and his household.
O He from whom I can hope for all goodness And I am safe from His anger at every evil. 
O He who gives a lot in exchange of a little.
O He who gives to one who asks Him.
O He who gives to one who does not ask Him and does not know Him,
Out of His affection and mercy. 
Give me, for my request is only to You alone, All the good of this world and all the good of the Hereafter.
Keep away from me, for my request is only to You alone, All the evil of this world and the evil of the Hereafter. For indeed it is not diminishing what is given by You. Increase (for) me from Your bounty, O The Generous.
(Then the 6th Imam held his beard in his left hand and gave a movement to the index finger in his right hand saying :) 
O The Sublime and The Distinguished,
O The Bountiful and The Magnanimous,
O the Gracious and the Mighty, 
Save my grey hairs of the beard from the fire (of Hell). ",After daily prayers,yamanarjoh.mp3,7,10,D,,,,,
2,Daily Dua 1,"Concerning this du'a 'Allamah Jawaad al Mulki al Tabreezi (alayh rahmah)  says that it is a du'a that by it many doors of knowledge are opened for those that are worthy.Shaykh al-Tusi has related that this noble writing came out of the  Sacred Precinct on the hand of that great Shaykh, Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Uthmaan ibn Sa'id -  may God be pleased with him. Recite it on each day of the month of Rajab.","O God, I ask Thee by the meaning of all that by which Thou art called upon by those who govern with Thy authority: those who are entrusted with Thy mystery, welcome Thy command, extol Thy power, and proclaim Thy majesty. I ask Thee by Thy will which speaks within them, for Thou hast appointed them mines for Thy words, and pillars of the profession of Thy Unity, Thy signs and Thy stations, which are never interrupted in any place. Through them knows he who knows Thee. There is no difference between Thee and them, save that they are Thy servants and Thy creation, their doing and undoing is in Thy hand, their origin is from Thee and their return is to Thee. They are aides, witnesses, testers, defenders, protectors and searchers.  With them Thou filled Thy heaven and Thy earth until it became manifest that there is no god but Thou. So I ask Thee by (all of) that, and by the positions of Thy mercy's might and by Thy Stations and Marks that Thou bless Muhammad and His household and increase me in faith and steadfastness. O Inward in His outwardness and Outward in His inwardness and hiddenness! O Separator of light and darkness ! O described by other than (His) Essence and well-known in other than (His) likeness! Delimitator of every delimited thing ! Witness of all that is witnessed! Bringer into existence of every existent! Counter of everything counted! Depriver of all that is deprived! There is none worshipped but Thou, Possessor of Grandeur and Generosity! O He who is not conditioned by ""how"" or determined by ""where""! O veiled from every eye! O Everlasting! O eternally Self-subsistent and Knower of all that is known! Bless Muhammad and his household and Thy elect servants, Thy mankind in veils, Thy angels brought nigh, and the untold multitudes (of angels) set in ranks and encircling (the Throne). And bless us in this our venerated and honored month and the sacred months that follow it In it bestow blessings upon us copiously, make large our portions, and fulfill for us (our) oaths, by Thy most tremendous, most tremendous, greatest and noblest Name, which Thou placed upon the day, and it brightened, and upon the night, and it darkened. And forgive us that of ourselves which Thou knowest and we know not, preserve us from sins with the best of preservations, suffice us with the sufficiencies of Thy determination, favor us with Thy fair regard, leave us not to other than Thee, hold us not back from Thy goodness, bless us in the lifespans Thou hast written for us, set aright for us the inmost center of our hearts, give us protection from Thee, cause us to act with the fairest of faith, and bring us to the month of fasting and the days and years that come after it, O Lord of Majesty and Splendor!

3,Daily Dua 2,"Shaykh al-Tusiy has also narrated that a document signed by Imam al-Mahdi (a.s) was received by Shaykh Abu’l-Qasim, Imam al-Mahdi’s representative, mentioning that the following supplication is recommended to be  recited in the month of Rajab:","O` Allah I ask You in the name of two grand personalities born in month of Rajab-Mohammad the second of Ali and his son Ali ibne Mohammad.
I seek Your best nearness through both of them. O from Whom good is sought and from Him is asked what He has. 
I ask You like a Sinner Confessing his sins which have completely covered him and whose unsound character has bound him down.  His bad habits and vices have therefore become protracted.  He seeks from You, pardon, a good return to You, forgiveness of his Sins, protection from hell fire and amnesty of his misdeeds for You are O` my Lord! his great hope and worthy of confidence. 
O` Allah! I ask You in the name of Your noble affairs and lofty resources to cover me in this year with Your vast Mercy and with Your well-spread bounties and grant me a convincing soul till my descent into the grave and its final destination, where it shall meet its fate.

4,Daily Dua 3,Third supplication of the month of Rajab,"O’ Allah! He who possesses abundant favours, restraint benefactions, encompassed blessing, and comprehensive strength, and immense favour and great gifts, beautiful support and plentiful offers.
O’ He who is not described by comparison, and not compared with a counterpart, and He is not overcome by anything with its helpers, O’ He who create and make all provision, He who inspire and make people to pronounce, He originate and commence, He ascends and elevated, He has power to punish but he do good, He who shape things and do it excellently, He who raise objection and notify, He who bestowed and accomplished it, He who give in abundant, He who grant and make it better.

He is alone in Benefaction and pride, there is no opposition to Him in His Omnipotence, O’ He who glory of His solemnity is passionate in every movement of kind imaginations, and peoples sight diminish in perceiving His Greatness.
O’ He whose Eyes are constraint to His Solemnity, and all supervision, succumbed to His Greatness and the minds are apprehensive due to His favour.
I seek from You with this laudation that no one deserved it except You, for what You have made incumbent for Yourself, O’ the best that hear among all hearer, O’ the best that see among the viewers, O’ He who possess firm strength.
Send Your blessing to the seal of the Prophets and to his holy household ( the truthful leaders), grant me a portion among the goods You have distributed in this holy month and make inevitable for me Your good destiny. Seal all my issues with felicity, let me alive with abundant life, and take my life in happiness and forgiveness, take over my rescue from the problems of the period between death and resurrection (Barzakhiy) and turn away from me the affliction of Munkar and Nakeer , and my eye be of grad tidings and hopeful, let me dwelled in your pleasure and Paradise with a firm and stable living and mighty kingdom, abundant blessing be upon Muhammad and upon his holy family.",Sahifa Mahdi (ajtfs),daily_rajab_12thimam_3.mp3,7,13,D,,,,,

        There is not a &quot;moving creature&quot; in the earth but the sustenance thereof depends 
        on Allah. He knows its habitation and its repository. All is in a manifest Book.

        He makes it available to whom He wills of his bondmen. He is the Oft-forgiving, 
        the Merciful. Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship, ease. That which Allah wills

        Be it known that the best a&#39;mal for middle of Rajab is Do&#39;a-e-Umme Dawood. It is 
        best for fulfilment of desires and removal of oppressions and calamities. Imam

        should perform it for illegitimate purpose. It contains Great Name of Allah 
        (Isme Azam) and every desire will be attained for which it is performed in spite 
        of all hurdles, even if doors of heaven and earth are shut as it were, Allah 
        will suffice even if all the mankind and genie are against the performer and 
        every body will be subjugated. If performed, in any other month other than 
        Rajab, in the middle of the month after observing fast on 13th, 14th and 15th it 
        will carry the same benefit. It is also beneficial to perform this amal on any

        <strong>Regular A&#39;amal -SHA’-BAAN</strong> </p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        Imam Ali bin Husayn Al Zanul Aabideen (A.S.) told his companions: “The Holy 
        Prophet (S.A.) used to observe fast during the whole month of Shaa’-baan. 
        Therefore whosoever, in love of the Holy Prophet (S.A.), wishes to seek nearness 
        to Allah and receive bounties, favours and rewards in this world and in the 
        Hereafter, must connect Shaa’-baan with Ramazaan (in the matter of fasting and 
        special prayers).</p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        1) It is highly desirable to observe fast on 1st, 2nd and 3rd Sha’baan, &amp; Pray 
        every night a 2 Rak-a’t Namaaz. In every Rak-a’t, after the recitation of Soorah 
        Al Faatih’ah, recite Soorah Al Ikhlaas 11 times.. </p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        2) Give Alms/Charity in HIS name “What are the best deeds that should be done in 
        Sha`ban.” The Imam (a.s) answered, “Almsgiving and seeking forgiveness are the 
        best deeds in Sha`ban. Verily, if anyone of you gives alms in Sha`ban, Almighty 
        Allah will breed that alms in the very same way as you breed your small camels. 
        Hence, this alms will be as huge as Mount Uhud on the Resurrection Day.”</p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        3) Recite 70 times:-</p>

    <p class=""style1"">
        According to narrations, the best supplications and invocations that are 
        advisably recited in Sha`ban are the prayers of seeking forgiveness of Almighty 
        Allah (i.e. istighfar). Hence, to seek Almighty Allah’s forgiveness seventy 
        times a day in Sha`ban is equal to seeking His forgiveness seventy Thousand 
        times a day in the other months</p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        4) Recite the following 1000 times, whenever the count reaches 1000, at any time 
        within the month, the a’mal is complete: </p>
<p class=""style1"" align=""left""

    <p class=""style1"">
        5) On every Thursday Fasting is recommended &amp; Recite 2 Rak-a’t Namaaz. In every 
        Rak-a’t, after the recitation of Soorah Al Faatih’ah, recite Soorah Al Ikhlaas 
        100 times. After the Salaam recite Salawaat 100 times. In this respect, a Hadith 
        reads that the heavens decorate themselves each Thursday in Sha`ban and the 
        angels pray Almighty Allah, saying, “O our God: (please do) forgive him who 
        observe fasting on this day and respond to his prayers.”</p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        The Holy Prophet (a.s) is also reported as saying, “If one observe fasting each

32,Daily Salawat on the Prophet (saws),It is reported through authentic sources that Imam Zainul Abideen (A.S.) used to recite the following Salavat every day in Sha`ban at the time sun passes the merdian (waqt-e-Zawal) and on the night of 15th Shaban.,"O’ Allah! Bestow Your blessing on Muhammad and his progeny-the tree of prophet hood and the afrode of Your Messages, the place of visits of the angels, the mine of Your Knowledge and the people of the Holy House of revelation.  O` Allah I Bestow Your blessing on Mohammad and his progeny who are a boat sailing in the deep waters of fathomless sea.  Safe is he who boarded it and drowned is he who discarded it.  Those who went ahead of them were misled and those legged behind them were ruined and those who adhered to them were united with them.  O` Allah! Bless Mohammad and his progeny who are the strong refuge, rescue for the distressed and the helpless, shelter for the fugitives and protection.  O` Allah! Bless Mohammad and his Progeny with plenty of Your blessings which should please them and grant them their due and it should be fulfilled with Your might-O` the Lord of the Worlds!   O Allah: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad— the pure, the pious, the righteous whose rights have been made incumbent upon us by You and the obedience to whom has been deemed obligatory upon us by You and whose (divinely commissioned) leadership has been (also) deemed obligatory upon us by You.  O` Allah! Bless Mohammad and his progeny and embellish my heart with obedience to You and disgrace me not with disobedience to You and bless me with tenderness for one struck with poverty from Your sustenance for You have blessed me with affluence in livelihood and because You have displayed Your justice on me and bestowed life on me to live under Your shade.  And this is the month You have attributed to Your Prophet the chief of Your Prophets month of Sha`aban You have encompassed it with your mercy and pleasure.  The Messenger of god used to keep vigil in devotion during its nights and observed fasts during its days humiliating himself before You honouring and respecting it till his departure from this World.   O` Allah! Help us in following his life pattern and in achieving his intercession.   O` Allah! Appoint him as an intercessor for me and his intercession is accepted by You and appoint him to show us a simple path towards You and make me his follower till I meet You on the day of resurrection in a state that You be pleased with me ignoring my sins for You have prescribed mercy and pleasure from you and my entertainment a peaceful abode and the abode of virtuous people: ",By Imam Zainul Abideen (a.s),shabansalwat.mp3,8,4,D,,,,,
33,Munajat of Shabaniyah,"It has been narrated by Ibn Khalawayh who commented on it, saying, “This is the prayer of  Imam `Ali Amir al-Mu'mineen and the Holy Imams, his descendants, (a.s) who used to recite it in the month of Shaban.”

","My Lord, bestow Your blessings on Muhammad and his descendants; respond to my prayer when I pray to You; listen to my call when I call You; and turn to me when I make my submission to You in confidence. I have come running to You and am standing before You imploring You in humility and hoping to get the reward You have for me. You know what is in my heart, and You are aware of what I need. You know my mind and are not unaware of my future and of my present, of what I want to begin my speech with; of the request I would utter, and of the hopes I have in regard to my ultimate lot.
My Lord, whatever You have destined for me up to tbe end of my life, whether concerning the open aspect of my life or the hidden aspect of it, is bound to come. What is to my advantage and what is to my disadvantage - all my losses and gains are in Your hand, not in the hand of anybody else.
My Lord, if You deprive me, who else will provide me; and if You let me down, who else will help me?
My Lord, I seek Your protection from Your anger and from earning Your displeasure. If I am not fit for gaining Your Mercy, You are certainly fit to be generous to me by virtue of Your Magnanimity.
My Lord, I see as if I am standing before You protected by my trust in You. You said what befitted You and covered me with Your forgiveness.
My Lord, if You forgive me, then who is more suited than You to do that? If the time of my death has come near and my deeds have not still brought me close to You, I make this confession of my sins a means of approaching You.
I have been unjust to my soul for I have not looked after it. It will certainly be doomed if You do not forgive it.
My Lord, You have always been kind to me during my life time. Therefore do not cut off Your favour from me at the time of my death.
My Lord, how can lose the hope of Your looking kindly, in me after my death, when you have always been good to me during my life.
My Lord, in my case do what befits You and bestow Your favour on me - a sinner enwrapped in his ignorance.
My Lord, You have concealed many of my sins in this world. I am in a greater need of their being conceded in the next. As You have not revealed my sins even to any of Your pious bondmen, do not expose me on the Day of Resurrection before everybody.
My Lord, Your generosity has expanded my aspiration, and Your forgiveness is superior to my deeds. Therefore gladden my heart by allowing me to meet You on the day You administer justice to Your bondmen.
My Lord, my apology to You is the apology of him who cannot afford his apology being not accepted. Therefore accept my apology, You the Most Magnanimous of those to whom the evildoers tender their apology.
My Lord, do not turn down my request; do not foil my desire; and do not cut off my hope and expectation of You.
My Lord, if You had wanted to disgrace me, You would not have guided me; and if You had wanted to expose my faults and vices, You would not have kept me safe and sound.
My Lord, I do not think that You will turn down my request for that in asking You for which I have spent my whole life.
My Lord, all praise is due to You, always and forever, growing not diminishing, as You like and please.
My Lord, if You condemn me for my crimes, I will cling to Your forgiveness, and if You hold me for my sins, I will cling to Your granting pardon. If You haul me into the hell, I will tell its inmates that I love You.
My Lord, if my deeds are too small in relation to how I should obey You, my aspirations are high enough as compared to what I should expect of You.
My Lord, how can I go away from You unsuccessful and disappointed, when I had a high hope that You will be kind enough to send me away enjoying safety and deliverance.
My Lord, I have wasted my life committing the crime of forgetting You and played havoc with my youth, intoxicated with keeping myself away from You.
My Lord, I did not wake up when I was under a delusion about You and was inclined to earn Your displeasure.
My Lord, I am Your bondman, son of Your bondman. I am standing before You, trying to use Your own magnanimity as a means of approaching You.
My Lord, I am a bondman of Yours, I want to rid myself of the sins I used to commit in Your presence because I lacked the sense of feeling ashamed that You were looking at me. I request You to forgive me, because forgiveness is
a characteristic of Your Kindness.
My Lord, I was not strong enough to move away from Your disobedience, except when You awakened me to Your love. I was exactly as You wanted me to be. I am thankful to You for introducing me to Your Kindness and purging my heart of the impurities of being inattentive to You.
My Lord, look upon me as the person whom You called and he responded to You, whom You helped by using his ser-vices, and he obeyed You. You Near One, Who is not far from one who is away from You. You Munificent, Who does not withhold His reward from one who hopes for it.
My Lord, provide me with a heart, the passion of which may bring it near You, with a tongue the truth of which may be submitted to You, and with a vision the nature of which may bring it close to You.
My Lord, whoever gets acquainted with You, is not un-known; whoever takes shelter under You, is not disappointed; and one to whom You turn, is not a slave. One who follows Your path is enlightened; and one who takes refuge in You, is saved.
My Lord, I have taken refuge in You. Therefore do not disappoint me of Your Mercy and do not keep me secluded from Your Kindness.
My Lord, place me among Your friends in the position of one who hopes for an increase in Your love.
My Lord, inspire me with a passionate love of remembering You so that I may keep on remembering You, and by Your Holy Name and Pure Position cherish my cheerful determination into a success.
My Lord, I invoke You to admit me to the place reserved for those who obey You, and to attach me to the nice abode of those who enjoy Your good pleasure. . . I can neither defend myself nor do I control what is advantageous for me.
My Lord, I am Your powerless sinning slave and Your repentant bondman. So do not make me one of those from whom You turn away Your face, and whom his negligence has secluded from Your forgiveness.
My Lord, grant me complete severance of my relations with everything else and total submission to You. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts with the light of their looking at You to the extent that they penetrate the veils of light and reach the Source of Grandeur, and let our souls get suspended by the glory of Your sanctity.
My Lord, make me one of those whom You call and they respond; when You look at and they are thunderstruck by Your majesty. You whisper to them secretly and they work for You openly.
My Lord, I have not allowed my pessimistic despair to overcome my good opinion about You, nor did I ever lose my hope of Your benevolence.
My Lord, if my errors have degraded me with You, You may forgive me in view of my unqualified reliance on You.
My Lord, if my sins have made me unfit to receive Your tender affection, my firm belief has reminded me of Your Compassion.
My Lord, if my disregard for preparations to meet You has put me to sleep, my knowledge of Your kind bounties has awakened me.
My Lord, if Your severe punishment calls me to Hell, the abundance of Your reward invites me to Paradise.
My Lord, I ask You and pray to You earnestly, I desire and request You to show Your favour to Muhammad and his descendants, make me one of those who always remember You and never violate the pledge they make to You, who do not fail to show You their gratitude and do not take Your orders lightly.
My Lord, let me be attached to the Light of Your Majestic Glory, so that I may know You alone, be away from others, and have a heart fearful of You and an eye watchful of You. May Allah's blessing and peace be on Muhammad and those of his descendants who are pure.",The Invocation,shabania.mp3,8,5,D,,,,,
34,Dua for 3rd Shaban,"Abu’l-Qasim ibn `Al’ al-Hamadaniy, the representative of Imam al-Hasan al-`Askary (a.s), received a document telling that our master, Grandson of the Holy Prophet (saws),Imam al-Husayn ibn `Ali (a.s), was born on the third of Sha`ban; therefore, you should observe fast on this day and recite the following supplication:  ","O Allah: I beseech You in the name of the one born on this day, the one promised with martyrdom before the beginning of his life and before his birth, the heavens and all their inhabitants wept for him; and so did the earth and those living one it; before his feet stepped on it; the mourned slain one; and the master of the Family (of Prophet hood);
and the one who shall be backed with victory on the Day of Return; the one whom has been awarded with the favor of the Imams’ being from his offspring as compensation of his being slain; and the one awarded with the favor of the soil of his grave carrying cure; and the one awarded with the favor that he will be triumphing when he will be returned;
and also the Prophet’s Successors from his offspring will be returned after the advent of their Rising Imam and after his occultation, so that they shall take revenge, and they shall retaliate, and they shall please the Omnipotent Lord, and they shall be the best supporters.
May Allah’s blessings be perpetually upon them whenever night and day succeed each other.
O Allah: I thus beg You in the name of them; and I implore You with the imploration of a sinful one who confesses of his guilt, and who has done evil to himself, due to his violations—the past and the present.
He thus beseeches You for protection from You up to the place of his grave.
O Allah: (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and his Offspring, and include us with his group (on the Resurrection Day)and allow us to dwell in the House of Honor with him, and in the abode of residence.
O Allah: as You have conferred upon us with the honor of our recognition of him, (please) confer upon us with the honor of being near to him, and bestow upon us with the bliss of accompanying him and enjoying a close rank to him,and include us with those who submit to him totally, and those who pray (You) for sending blessings upon him whenever they mention him,and also upon all his Successors and Selected Ones, whom are defined by You as twelve persons,being the luminous stars,and the Arguments against all humankind.
O Allah: and (please) grant us on this day the best of grants,and make all our prayers on this day responded, in the same way as You gifted al-Husayn to Muhammad: his grandfather, and in the same way as the angels Futrus sought refuge with his (i.e. al-Husayn) cradle we are  thus seeking refuge with his tomb after him (i.e. his martyrdom) as we are witnessing the soil of him and expecting his return.

Thy Light, soft, pleasant and caressing, Thy splendor, had come in view bright and brilliant, for the “Bright sigh”, (so far) invisible and hidden in the obscurity of the darkness, the covering had been taken off, his arrival in this world was the basis of all kindness, the Angels stood witness.

Accompany that which comes down in the “Grand Night” the controllers of the Day of Judgment and resurrection, interpreters of the “Revelations”, and those who make known what to do and what not to do.
O Allah send blessing on their seal and representative, un seeable to their people, make his days, his return, his time, reach maturity, (let us be with him), as his helpers, let us be his attacking comrades to hunt up and eliminate the beasts (in human shapes), register our names as his supporters and sincere friends, bring us to life again in his reign, gentle and loving, happy and satisfied in his company, and steadfast in his cause, free from sins, O the Most Merciful!

O` my Allah the seekers have presented before You their requests in this night and the ambitious has resolved to reach Your guidance and the seekers are hoping Your grace and bounties. And in this night you bestow Your hidden bounties, the provisions, gifts and presents upon those of Your creatures whom You please and You deny the same to the one for whom no divine decree has been ordained. And here I am you worthless bondmen in want but hopeful for getting grace and bounties. O` my Master if You have kindly bestowed in this night on any one from Your creation and benefits, please bestow Your blessings no Mohammad and his pure and purified progeny, the best of the learned, and be kind to bestow on me Your wealth and bounties.  O` the Lord of the Prophets and pure progeny and His perfect greetings of salutatio0ns on them. Verily Allah is praise worthy and glorious. 
O` Allah I invoke you as taught by You .  You therefore grant me my requests as You did promise.  You surely do not go against Your promise. 
O` Allah! Send Your Blessings on Mohammad and his Progeny, Ameen. ",Advised by Sheikh Toosi and Kafami (ra),ilahitarradda.mp3,8,16,D,,,,,
44,Dua for 15 Shaban,"The Holy Prophet (S.A.) used to recite the following in Sajdah tonight after the Tahajjud prayers:  [It can also be recited tonight after praying a 10 Raka’t Namaaz in 5 sets of 2 Raka’t each; in each Raka’t recite Soorah Al Faatih’ah once, and Soorah Al Ikhlaas 10 times]:","I prostrate my self in adoration before Thee, my thoughts and feelings in close attention, putting faith in Thee from the bottom of my heart.
These are my two hands and that which they pluck and gather for me, O the Great, (to do) every noble deed reliance is upon Thee, forgive my serious offences because, beyond a shadow of doubt, no one can forgive the grave transgression except the Great Lord.
I adhere close to the Light of Thy Being that had illuminated the heavens and the earths, removed and exposed the darkness, put in order the “operation”, from the beginning to the end, at all times free from violent and unexpected changes to the worse, absence of recovery and adjustment and discontinuation of the supply of natural resources.
O Allah give me a knowing fearing, clean conscience, free from hypocrisy, which is neither renegade nor villainous. I put my face on the earth and roll in the dust because it is imposed as a duty that I prostrate myself in adoration before Thee",After tahajjud prayers,sajadaka.mp3,8,17,D,,,,,

        <strong>15th Sha&#39;aban - Night A&#39;amal &amp; Birth of Imam Mehdi atfs</strong></p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        The Holy Prophet (sa.) had said that during the night of 15th Shaba&#39;an the 
        Almighty takes decisions in the matters of sustenance, life and death and 
        welfare of the people. Next to the “Night of Qadr” the night of 15th Sha’baan is 
        the most auspicious night (also known as “night of Baraat”). According to the 
        Imams Muhammad bin Ali Al Baqir (as.) and Jaa’far bin Muhammad As Sadiq (as.) 
        Allah swt has promised to fulfill every legitimate desire put forward to Him 
        tonight. During this night Allah (swt) bestows on HIS people from HIS bounty &amp; 
        forgives them out of HIS grace &amp; generosity .Of the blessings of this night is 
        that ,at the dawn of this night ,was born the Leader of the Time Imam Mehdi 
        (atfs) in Samarra -Iraq in the yr 255 AH . Ahadith in the book Iqbalul A‘mal 
        &quot;Therefore, stay awake this night in prayer and worship and encourage your Ummah 
        to also keep awake this night in order to get closer to Allah (Glorified and 
        Exalted is He) through their actions since this is a noble night. This is a 
        night in which not a single person supplicates to Allah except that his prayers 
        are accepted. Nobody asks for a single thing on this night except that it will 
        be given to him. No one asks Allah for forgiveness except that his sins are 
        wiped out. No one turns in repentance to Allah except that He accepts their 
        repentance. Whoever is deprived of the goodness of this night has definitely 
        been deprived of something great.&quot; Almighty Allah has chosen this night for the 
        Ahl al-Bayt, in the same way as He has chosen the Qadr Night for our 
        Prophet—peace be upon him and his Family. The first thing that that Salik (the 
        Wayfarer on the path towards Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He) must perform on 
        this night is that he must remove the material pleasures and enjoyments of this 
        world from in front of his eyes (and from his heart) and in order to make the 
        most of this special night and ensure that all of his actions are performed 
        properly, he must think to himself that tonight is his last night on this Earth 
        (meaning that tomorrow he shall die) and thus, he will no longer have the 
        opportunity to perform any more good deeds and that tomorrow the Day of Judgment 
        will take place. </p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        <strong>Aamal for Night of Fifteenth Shaban</strong></p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        It is advisable to stay awake during this full night in prayer as it has many 
        rewards Ahadith has confirmed that as for one who spends this whole night with 
        acts of worship, his heart will not die when other hearts die.</p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        1) Recite 100 times :</p>
    <p class=""style1"">
        <strong><em>Subh&#39;aanallah Walh&#39;amdu Lillah Wa-Laa Ilaaha Illallah Ho Wal Allahu

        ad-Dukhan, Verse 4) The Imam (peace be upon him) replied, The meaning of this is 
        the night of the 15th of Sha‘ban. I swear by the One who holds the life of ‘Ali 
        in His hands there is not a single servant of Allah except that all the good and 
        bad that will reach him in this year is divided up and handed out on the 15th of 
        Sha‘ban and this good and bad will continue from the 15th of Sha‘ban until the 
        next year on the same night. The servant who stays up this night and recites the

50,Short dua,"Imam al-Ridha(a.s) is reported as saying, “If one observes fasting on the last three days of Sha`ban and attach it to the obligatory fasting of Ramadan, Almighty Allah will reward him as if  he has observed fasting for two consecutive months.”
It has been narrated in the book `Uyun al-Akhbar al-Ridha from Abi Salt al-Harawi that when he visited Imam al-Ridha (a.s) on the last Friday of Sha`ban, the Imam said to him, “Abu’lalt: The majority of Sha`ban has passed. This is the last Friday in it. You should thus settle what you have missed in this month by working hard in the rest of it. You may supplicate, seek forgiveness of Almighty Allah, recite the Holy Qur'an, and repent before Almighty Allah from your sins so that you receive the month of Ramadan with pure sincerity to Almighty Allah. You must fulfill all the trusts that you are liable to settle; and do not bear malice against any of your brethren-in-faith; and you must give up any sin that you commit. Fear Almighty Allah and trust in Him in secret and openly, for ‘If any one puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is (Allah) for him. For Allah will surely accomplish his purpose: verily, for all things has Allah appointed a due proportion. 65/3’
In the rest days of Sha`ban, you may repeat the following supplication very much for Almighty Allah saves many people from Hellfire on account of the sanctity of this month:",O Allah: If You have not forgiven us in the past days of Shaban (please do) forgive us in the rest of it.,Last days of Shaban,,8,22,D,,,,,
51,Dua for last night,Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) used to say the following supplication at the last night of Sha`ban and the first night of Ramadhan,"O’ Allah! This is the blessed month in which the Qur˜an was revealed as guidance for mankind and clear evidence of guidance and discrimination (of the right from the wrong) is being witnessed by us. Therefore, keep us healthy in it and keep us sound in our faith in it and accept it from us in a state of prosperity and health granted to us by You, O’ He who acknowledges and gives answer many times to the very little offered to Him and thanks us by giving us plenty, accept my simple (acts).
O’ Allah! I ask You to provide me with a way towards all good and keep me away from all that You do not like, O’ the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!
O’ One who forgave me and forgave me all my misdeeds committed secretly. O’ One who does not punish me for my disobedience! Your forgiveness. Your forgiveness! Your forgiveness! O’ the Generous!
O’ my Lord! You admonished me but I did not respond; You reproached me concerning Your prohibited (things) but I cared not for it - what excuse do I now have? So then pardon me O’ the Generous!
Your pardon! Your Pardon!
O’ Allah! I beseech you for ease at the time of my death and forgiveness at the time of reckoning (on the Day of Resurrection). The sins of Your slave are great (in number) but forgiveness from You should serve my purpose well. O’ the One deserving to be feared and fitted to pardon. Your pardon! Your Pardon!
O’ Allah! I am Your servant, son of Your servant and son of Your slave girl, I am weak and stand in need of Your Mercy. You are Omnipotent and Mighty. You have reckoned their deeds and accordingly distributed to them their livelihood and made them creation after creation of different languages and colours. people know not what You know and esteem You not with the estimation due to You and all of us stand in need of Your mercy. Do not turn not Your face away from us and ordain in Your decree to make me among Your creatures - virtuous in deeds and hopes and in your decree and verdict.
O’ Allah! Keep me alive to live the best life (of righteousness) and cause me to die the best death in a state of love (in my heart) towards Your friends and in a state of enmity towards Your enemies and with a desire to meet You and fearing You and with humility and fulfilling the promise and submitting to Your will, testifying to Your Book and following the life-pattern of Your Messenger (Muhammad).
O’ Allah! That which lays hold of my mind (from the following): doubt, disbelief, disappointment, intoxication, conceit, insolence, vanity, show, desire for fame, disagreement, hypocrisy, infidelity, transgression, disobedience, pride or any thing that You do not love may kindly be substituted with: faith according to Your promise, inspiration to fulfill Your promises, contentment with Your decision, piety in the world, a desire of that which is with you (good) impression, mental tranquility, and a sincere repentance. I ask You O’ Lord! of the Worlds for all of these.
O’ my Lord! Disobedience to You is due to Your forbearance (of us disobeying you), and obedience is due to Your generosity and magnanimity as if You were never disobeyed. I and the other person who never disobeyed are the dwellers of Your earth. Therefore with Your grace, pardon me and invite us to You with Your goodness, O’ the Most Merciful of those who show Mercy! And may the everlasting prayers of Allah be upon Muhammad and his progeny, unlimited blessing which neither could be reckoned nor appreciated by any one except You. O’ the Most Merciful of those who show Mercy!",of Shaban,lastshaban.mp3,8,23,D,,,,,
52,Welcoming Ramadhan,Imam Ali Ibn Hussain(as) 's Supplication for the Coming of the Month of Ramadan,"Praise belongs to God who guided us to His praise and placed us among the people of praise, that we might be among the thankful for His beneficence and that He might recompense us for that with the recompense of the good-doers!   And praise belongs to God who showed favour to us through His religion, singled us out for His creed, and directed us onto the roads of His beneficence, in order that through His kindness we might travel upon them to His good pleasure, a praise which He will accept from us and through which He will be pleased with us!   And praise belongs to God who appointed among those roads His month, the month of Ramadan, the month of fasting, the month of submission, the month of purity, the month of putting to test, the month of standing in prayer, in which the Qur'an was sent down as guidance to the people, and as clear signs of the Guidance and the Separator!  He clarified its excellence over other months by the many sacred things and well-known excellencies which He placed therein, for He made unlawful in it what He declared lawful in others to magnify it, He prohibited foods and drinks in it to honour it, and He appointed for it a clear time which  He (majestic and mighty is He) allows not to be set forward and accepts not to be placed behind.   Then He made one of its nights surpass the nights of a thousand months and named it the Night of Decree; in it the angels and the Spirit descend by the leave of their Lord upon every command, a peace constant in blessings until the rising of the dawn upon whomsoever He will of His servants according to the decision He has made firm.   O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, inspire us with knowledge of its excellence, veneration of its inviolability, and caution against what Thou hast forbidden within it, and help us to fast in it by our restraining our limbs from acts of disobedience toward Thee and our employing them in that which pleases Thee, so that we lend not our ears to idle talk and hurry not with our eyes to diversion,   we stretch not our hands toward the forbidden and stride not with our feet toward the prohibited, our bellies hold only what Thou hast made lawful and our tongues speak only what Thou hast exemplified, we undertake nothing but what brings close to Thy reward and pursue nothing but what protects from Thy punishment! Then rid all of that from the false show of the false showers and the fame seeking of the fame seekers, lest we associate therein anything with Thee or seek therein any object of desire but Thee!   O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, in it make us attend to the appointed moments of the five prayers within the bounds Thou hast set, the obligations Thou hast decreed, the duties Thou hast assigned, and the times Thou hast specified;   and in the prayers make us alight in the station of the keepers of their stations, the guardians of their pillars, their performers in their times, as Thy servant and Thy messenger set down in his Sunna (Thy blessings be upon him and his Household) in their bowings, their prostrations, and all their excellent acts, with the most complete and ample ritual purity and the most evident and intense humility!   Give us success in this month to tighten our bonds of kin with devotion and gifts, attend to our neighbours with bestowal and giving, rid our possessions from claims, purify them through paying the alms, go back to him who has gone far from us, treat justly him who has wronged us, make peace with him who shows enmity toward us (except him who is regarded as an enemy in Thee and for Thee, for he is the enemy whom we will not befriend, the party whom we will not hold dear),   and seek nearness to Thee through blameless works which will purify us from sins and preserve us from renewing faults, so that none of Thy angels will bring for Thee the kinds of obedience and sorts of nearness-seeking unless they be less than what we bring!  O God, I ask Thee by the right of this month and by the right of him who worships Thee within it from its beginning to the time of its passing, whether angel Thou hast brought nigh to Thee, prophet Thou hast sent, or righteous servant Thou hast singled out, that Thou bless Muhammad and his Household, make us worthy of the generosity Thou hast promised Thy friends, make incumbent for us what Thou hast made incumbent for those who go to great lengths in obeying Thee, and place us in the ranks of those who deserve through Thy mercy the highest elevation!   O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, turn us aside from deviation in professing Thy Unity, falling short in magnifying Thee, in Thy religion, blindness toward Thy path, heedlessness of Thy inviolability, and being deceived by Thy enemy, the accursed Satan!   O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, and when in every night of this month's nights Thou hast necks which Thy pardon will release and Thy forgiveness disregard, place our necks among those necks and place us among the best folk and companions of this our month!   O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, efface our sins along with the effacing of its crescent moon, and make us pass forth from the ill effects of our acts with the passing of its days, until it leaves us behind, while within it Thou hast purified us of offenses and rid us of evil deeds!   O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, and should we go off to one side in this month, set us aright; should we swerve, point us straight; and should Thy enemy Satan enwrap us, rescue us from him!   O God, fill this month with our worship of Thee, adorn its times with our obedience toward Thee, help us during its daytime with its fast, and in its night with prayer and pleading toward Thee, humility toward Thee, and lowliness before Thee, so that its daytime may not bear witness against our heedlessness, nor its night against our neglect!   O God, make us like this in the other months and days as long as Thou givest us life, and place us among Thy righteous servants, those who shall inherit Paradise, therein dwelling forever, those who give what they give, while their hearts quake, that they are returning to their Lord those who vie in good works, outracing to them!  O God, bless Muhammad and his Household in every time, in all moments, and in every state, to the number that Thou hast blessed whomsoever Thou hast blessed and to multiples of all that, through multiples which none can count but Thee! Surely Thou art Accomplisher of what Thou desirest. ",Dua by Imam Sajjad (as),ramwelcome.mp3,9,1,D,,,,,

O Allah: (please) help us observe fasting in it, And accept it from us, And keep us safe during it, And help us observe it adequately, And keep it sound for us with easiness and good health from You.

I have faith in Him Who lights up darknesses through you, illuminates jet-black shadows by you, appointed you one of the signs of His kingdom And one of the marks of His authority, So, He identified time through You, And humbled you through increase and decrease, And rising and setting, And illumination and eclipse. In all of this you are obedient to Him,  And prompt toward His will. Glory be to Him! How wonderful is what He has arranged in Your situation! How subtle what He has made for Your task! He has made You the key to a new month for a new situation. So I ask Allah, my Lord and Your Lord, my Creator and Your Creator, my Determiner and Your Determiner, my Form-giver and Your Form-giver, that He bless Mu¦ammad and his Household and appoint You a crescent of blessings not effaced by days and of purity not defiled by sins; a crescent of security from blights and of safety from evil deeds; a crescent of auspiciousness containing no misfortune, of prosperity accompanied by no adversity, of ease not mixed with difficulty, of good unstained by evil; a crescent of security and faith, favor and good-doing, safety and submission! O Allah, bless Mu¦ammad and his Household, place us among the most satisfied of those over whom the crescent has risen, the purest of those who have looked upon it, the most fortunate of those who have worshiped You under it; give us the success during [the new month] to repent, preserve us within it from misdeeds and exposition to punishment, allot to us within it thanksgiving for Your favor, clothe us during it in the shields of well-being, and complete for us Your kindness by perfecting therein obedience to You! Surely You are All-kind, Praiseworthy. And bless Mu¦ammad and his Household, the good, the pure. And grant us aid from You to carry out that which You have ordered us to do in it; Such as the obedience to You which You have made incumbent upon us, and accept them from us, for You are the most Generous of all those who show generosity and the most Merciful of all those who show mercy.

O Allah, the Lord of the sacred city and the Lord of the rukn (the corner of the holy Kab-ah where the black stone is lyings) and the maqam ( the place in the holy Kab-ah where prophet Ibrahim used to pray ), and the Lord of the lawful and the unlawful, convey our salam to Your prophet, Muhammad.

[O My means in my troubles! O my companion in my difficulties! O my guardian in my happiness! O the ultimate of my inclinations! You cover up my shortcomings, afford security in the event of crises and fearful disasters, therefore overlook my transgression. O the most merciful.
Then say
O Allah I call on You about the troubles which can not be driven off by anyone, other than You, about the kindness which does not come forward except from You, about the anguish which does not pass away unless be put to flight by You, about the affection which does not grow intense unless You give reins to it; about the wants and needs which remains unfulfilled unless You satisfy them. O Allah, so as it was Your pleasure that You allowed me to make a request to treat me mercifully on account of Your glory, I repeat frequently, then O my Master it must surely have been Your intention that what I ask for would be given, what I hope for would be made available in large quantity, of better quality, regularly, and would be kept safe from that which I avoid and run from unto You. May be I do not deserve to get Your mercy, but certainly Your mercy has the right to reach me and promote my cause. May be I am not entitled to satisfaction, but Your generosity and kindness is able to encompass all things, therefore it will surely cover me also. O my Allah, O compassionate, I beseech You in the name of Your kindest disposition to send blessings on Muhammad and on his children, and remove my hardships, dispel my sorrows and troubles, have mercy on me through Your mercy and keep me alive amidst Your liberal bounties.

I beseech You; O my Reliance at all griefs;
And my Aide at all hardships,
(I beseech You) by these names to grant me security against the punishments in this worldly life as well as the Next Life.
And I beseech You to rebuff from me by these Names all things that are evil, feared, and jeopardized,
And to rebuff from me the sights of the wrongdoers who intend evil to me—evil against which You have warned;
And to rebuff from me their hearts and change the evil that they conceal in themselves into the good that they do not have,
And none else has it save You, O the All-generous.
O Allah: (please) do not refer me to myself, because I will fail to manage it,
Or to the people, because they will reject me.
And do not disappoint me while I am pleasing You,
And do not torture me while I am praying You.
O Allah: I am praying You as You ordered me to do,
So, (please) answer me as You promised me to do.
O Allah: (please) make the best of my lifetime be that which is near to my death.
O Allah: (please) do not change my body,
And do not stop adding to my shares (from Your favors)
And do not cause harm to my friend.
I seek Your protection against deadly diseases,
And against harsh poverty,
And against humiliation and bad company.
O Allah: (please) entertain my heart against all things that cannot act as my provision to You,
And that cannot avail me on the day when I will meet You,
Be it legal or illegal,
And then (please) grant me power over it as well as mighty, contentment, revulsion of it, and Your satisfaction with it.
O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy;
O Allah: all praise be to You for Your abundant gifts.
And all praise be to you for Your uninterrupted favors,
By which You have saved me from adverse matters,
And through which You have bestowed upon me with the donations of pleasure,
Although I persisted in carelessness,
And I kept some hardheartedness;
Nevertheless, all such deeds of mine did not stop You from pardoning me,
And covering that,
And allowing me to dispose with Your bounties that are at my hand,
And continuing in doing good to me,
And overlooking the ill deeds of which I confessed to You,
And my violations of doing acts of disobedience to You.
O Allah: I beseech You by every Name that is Yours,
And due to which it becomes incumbent upon You to respond to those who pray You by it,
And I beseech You in the name of all those who enjoy a right with You
And in the name of Your duties that are incumbent upon all those who are less than You are,
(I beseech You) to send blessings upon Muhammad, Your servant and Your Messenger, and upon his Household;
And as for anyone who intends evil to me, (please) have control on his hearing and sight
And before him and behind him
And from his right side and from his left side,
And (please) prevent him from harming me through Your might and Your power.
O He with Whom there is no other lord to be prayed;
O He above Whom there is no other creator to be feared;
O He other than Whom there is no god to be feared;
O He Who has no assistant that may be seen first; 
O He Who has no janitor that may be bribed;
O He Who has no doorkeeper that may be called;
O He Whose abundant gifting increases him nothing but more generosity and more magnanimity; 
And the flow of sinning (of His servants) increases him nothing but forgiveness and pardon.
(please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,
And do to me that which befits You,
And do not do to me that which I deserve,
For You are the worthiest of being feared and the worthiest of forgiving.",Time of Sahar - 4,idres.mp3,9,28,D,,,,,
79,Dua Ya Uddati,Sheikh Tusi has mentioned the following supplication to be said at the last hours of Ramadhan nights,"In the Name of Allah; the All-beneficent, the All-merciful. O my means in troubles: O my Companion in hardships: O the Provider of my amenities; O the utmost of my desires. It is You Who conceals my defects, Who relieves my apprehensions, and Who overlooks my slips; so, (please do) forgive my sin. O Allah: I pray You for the submission of faith before I encounter the submission of humiliation in Hellfire. O the One: O the Absolute: O the Besought of all: O He Who neither begets nor is He begotten, and there is none like to Him. O He Who confers upon him who beseeches Him on account of His sympathy and mercy; and He Who initially grants welfare to those who have not asked for it, on account of His liberality and generosity. I beseech You in the name of Your endless generosity that You bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and bestow upon me with mercy—vast and comprehensive— by which I can win the welfare of this world as well as the Next World. O Allah: I do pray for Your forgiveness for the sins from which I had repented to You but I committed them again. And I pray for Your forgiveness for my righteous acts that although I intended them purely for Your sake, some purposes that are not intended for You intruded upon them. O Allah: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and pardon my transgression and my offenses in the name of Your forbearance and magnanimity; O the All-generous. O He- one who prays Him will never be disappointed; one who seeks His rewards will never be devoid of goodness. O He Who is so Elevated that nothing can ever be higher than He is; and Who is so Nigh that nothing can ever be closer that He is: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and have mercy upon me— O He Who split asunder the sea for (Prophet) Moses— this very night, this very night, this very night, this very hour, this very hour, this very hour. O Allah: (please do) purify my heart from hypocrisy; and purify my acts from showing off; and purity my tongue from telling untruths; and purify my eye from treason, for You know the steal Your looks and that which the breasts conceal. O my Lord: this is the manner of him who seeks Your protection from Hellfire. This is the manner of him who seeks Your shelter against Hellfire. This is the manner of him who seeks Your aid against Hellfire. This is the manner of him who flees to You from Hellfire. This is the manner of him who returns to You carrying his offenses, confessing of his sins, and repenting to You—his Lord. This is the manner of the miserable, the poor. This is the manner of the fearful, the seeker of Your refuge. This is the manner of the aggrieved, the distressed. This is the manner of the depressing, the gloomy. This is the manner of the stranger, the drowned. This is the manner of the alienated, the frightened. This is the manner of him who cannot find anyone save You to forgive his sins; who cannot find anyone save You to give him power; and who cannot find anyone save You to relieve his grief. O Allah, O All-generous: (please) do not burn my face with Hellfire after I have prostrated myself before You and I have soiled my face for You. Of course, this is not a personal favor that I have done to myself; rather it is on account of Your Praiseworthy favor and guidance to me. So, have mercy, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord…Keep saying as much as one breath takes, upon my weakness, upon my confusedness, upon the softness of my skin, upon the separation of my organs, upon the dispersal of my flesh, body, and corpse, upon my loneliness and lonesomeness in my grave, and upon my anxiety at the least misfortune that inflicts me. I beseech You, O Lord, for delight and happiness on the Day of regret and remorse. (Please do) whiten my face, O Lord, when some faces will be blackened. (Please do) secure me against the Supreme Horror. I beseech You for good tidings when hearts and sights shall be turned about and for good tidings when I depart this life. All praise be to Allah Whom I hope for aiding me in my life and Whom I want to act as my Provision on the day of my neediness. All praise be to Allah Whom alone do I beseech and I never beseech anyone rather than Him; and even if I beseech anyone else, he will definitely let me down. All praise be to Allah for Whom I hope and I never hope for anyone rather than Him; and even if I hope for anyone else, he will definitely disappoint me. All praise be to Allah, the All-benefactor, the All-donor, the All-favorer, the All-liberal, the Lord of Majesty and Honor, the Source of all bounties, And the Cause of all good deeds, the Ultimate Goal of all desires,  and the Answerer of all needs. O Allah: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and grant me conviction and having good idea about You; and fix my hope for You in my heart; and deprive me of putting my hope in anyone other than You, so that I shall hope for none but You and I shall trust none but You. O He Who is Benignant to whom He pleases: (please do) have benignity towards me in all my manners in the very way that You like and please. O my Lord: verily, I am too weak to encounter Your Fire; therefore, (please) do not punish me with Your Fire. O my Lord: (please do) have mercy upon my prayers, my earnest imploring, my fear, my humiliation, my neediness, my seeking Your protection, and my seeking Your refuge. O my Lord: I am too weak to seek earnings in this world and You are Ample-giving and All-generous. I beseech You, O my Lord, in the name of Your power over that, and Your supremacy over it, and Your dispensing with it, and my urgent need for it that You grant me sustenance in this year, in this month, on this day, at this hour— sustenance by which You may make me dispense with what the others possess, from Your sustenance, legal and nice. O my Lord: from You do I ask; and for You do I desire; and for You do I hope; and You are the worthiest of hope. I hope for none but You  and I trust in none but You. O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy: O my Lord: I have wronged myself; so, (please do) forgive me, have mercy upon me, and grant me good health. O the Hearer of all sounds; O He Who takes precedence over everything that passes away; O the Reviver of all souls after death; O He Whom is not screened by murk; O He Whom is not made confused by sounds; O He Whom is not engaged by something against another thing; (please do) grant Muhammad—peace be upon him and his Family—the best of all that for which he has besought You and the best of all that which has been asked from You for him and the best all that which You shall be asked for him up to the Resurrection Day; and grant me good health so that I may enjoy my life; and end my life with a happy end so that my sins may not injure me. O Allah: (please do) make me satisfied with that which You have decided for me so that I will not ask anyone else for anything. O Allah: (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad And open to me the stores of Your mercy and cover me with a mercy from You owing to which You will not punish me neither in this world nor in the Hereafter; and grant me from Your limitless favor sustenance, legal and nice, owing to which You will make me dispense with anyone other than You; increasing my gratitude to You, and my neediness and submission before You, and increasing my dispensing with and doing without everyone save You. O the All-benefactor; O the All-donor; O the All-favorer; O the All-liberal, O the All-omnipotent; O the All-sovereign; (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and relieve me from all grievances; and decide the most excellent for me; and bless all my affairs; and settle all my needs. O Allah: (please do) make easy for me all that which I anticipate to be difficult, for it is quite easy for You to make easy for me that which I anticipate to be difficult; and (please do) facilitate for me that I anticipate to be complicated; and give vent to that which I anticipate to be narrow; and save me from that which I anticipate to cause me distress; and guard me from that which I anticipate to cause me misfortune; O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy. O Allah: (please do) fill in my heart with love for You, with fear from You, with belief in You, with faith in You, with terror from You, and with eagerness to You; O the Lord of Majesty and Honor. O Allah: I owe You some rights; so, (please do) consider them alms and excuse me from their liabilities. I also owe people some responsibilities; so, (please do) release me from their charges. You have instructed us to honor our guests; and I am Your guest at this night; so, (please do) decide Paradise for me as Your honoring me at this night. O the Grantor of Paradise; O the Grantor of forgiveness; and there is no power nor might save with You. ",Time of Sahar - 5,uddate.mp3,9,29,D,,,,,

81,Dua for Iftar,"A Hadith reads, ""Almighty Allah (swt) releases from Hellfire one million persons in the last hour everyday in the month of Ramadhan; therefore pray to Almighty Allah (swt) to include you with these released ones.

It is advisable to postpone breaking one's fast to later than the Isha Prayer unless one is too weak to keep fasting or other people are waiting for you to break the fast.

It is advisable to begin breaking fast with dates.

It is advisable to recite Sura Qadr at the time of breaking the fast.

It is advisable to offer food to other fasting people even if with a single date and a drink of water. Allamah Hilli in al-Risalah al-Sa'diyyah has narrated that Imam Ja'far Sadiq (as) has said, ""If a believer treats another believer with a single morsel of food in Ramadhan, Almighty Allah (swt) will give him the reward of freeing thirty believing slaves and his wishes will be granted.""
","O my Allah, for Thee, I fast, and with the food Thou gives me I break the fast, and I rely on Thee.
In the name of Allah, O Allah, we fast, and with the food Thou gives us we break the fast, an obligation we fulfill, and Thou art Hearer, Knower

93,MUQALLIBA ALQULUBI WA ALABSARI,"Recite the following supplication It has been narrated that `Ali ibn Hammad visited Imam Ja`far al-Sadiq (a.s) at the twenty-first night of Ramadhan. “Have you bathed yourself, Hammad?” asked the Imam. “Yes, I have,” answered Hammad. The Imam (a.s) then asked him to stand by him so as to imitate him in offering the prayers. Hammad did. When they finished all the prayers, the Imam (a.s) began to say the supplications  At dawn, the Imam (a.s) declared the adhan , uttered the iqamah  and then summoned some of his servant to participate in the prayer. They all stood behind the Imam (a.s) who led their congregational Fajr Prayer reciting Surahs of al-Fatihah and al-Qadr in the first Rak`ah and Surahs of al-Fatihah and al-Tawhid in the second. When he finished the post-prayer invocations of glorifying Almighty Allah, praising Him, venerating Him, thanking Him, praying Him for sending blessings upon the Holy Prophet and his Household, and praying Him for the good of all the believing men and women as well as all the Muslims, Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) prostrated himself. The companions could not hear anything except the Imam’s breaths for a long time. Hammad narrated: I could then hear him saying the following supplication, as quoted from Iqbal al-A`mal 1:336:
","There is no god save You, the Transformer of hearts and sights 
There is no god save You, the Creator of the creatures,
While You do not need them.
There is no god save You, the Originator of the creation.
And nothing of creation decreases any of Your Kingdom.
There is no god save You, the Resurrector of those who are in graves.
There is no god save You, the Manager of all affairs.
There is no god save You, the Master and the most Omnipotent of all those who claim omnipotence. 
There is no god save You. It is You Who causes water to flow in hard rocks.
There is no god save You. It is You Who causes water to flow in plants.
There is no god save You, the Maker of the flavors of fruits.
There is no god save You. It is You Who keeps count of the number of the drops of rain and what is loaded by the clouds. 
There is no god save You. It is You Who keeps count of the number of what the wind carry in the air.
There is no god save You. It is You Who keeps count of what is there in oceans—the wet and the dry.
There is no god save You. It is You Who keeps count of whatever creeps in the darknesses of oceans and in the layers of the earth. 
I beseech You by Your Name that You have used for Yourself
Or You have stored for Yourself in the hidden knowledge of You.
And I beseech You by every name that is ascribed to You by any of Your created beings:
Such as the Prophets, the veracious ones, the martyrs, or any of Your angels. 
And I beseech You by Your Name that You answer anyone who beseeches You by it,
And You respond to anyone who asks You by it.
And I beseech You in the name of the duty that is incumbent upon Mu¦ammad and his Household—Your blessings and benedictions be upon them—toward You,
And by the duty that You have made incumbent upon Yourself toward them,
And through which You granted them Your favors,
(please) bless Mu¦ammad, Your servant and Your Messenger:
The caller to You by Your permission,
And Your incandescent lantern from among Your servants
In Your lands and Your heavens,
And he whom You made mercy for the peoples,
And light through whom the believers have obtained their light;
He this conveyed to us the good tidings about Your abundant reward
And also warned us against Your painful chastisement.
I bear witness that he carried to us the truth from the True God, and he verified the Messengers.
And I bear witness that those who belied him shall certainly taste the painful chastisement.
I beseech You, O Allah; O Allah; O Allah;
O our God; O our God; O our God;
O my Master; O my Master; O my Master;
O my Lord; O my Lord; O my Lord.
I beseech You in this early morning to bless Mu¦ammad and the Household of Mu¦ammad,
And to include me with Your servants and beseechers upon whom You confer the most abundant of Your rewards,
And to confer upon me with releasing me from Hellfire,
O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy.
And I beseech You to settle for me all that which I asked from You and also all that which I did not ask from You; that which belongs to Your splendid majesty,
That which I would ask from You if I knew it,
(and I beseech You to) send blessings upon Mu¦ammad and his Household,
And to permit the Relief of him whose relief achieves the relief of Your intimate servants and Your select ones from among Your created beings,
And through whom You will terminate and eradicate the oppressors.
(Please) hasten that, O the Lord of the worlds.
And (please) grant me my requests, O the Lord of majesty and honor, 
As regarding all that which I have asked You from my needs for this worldly life and the Hereafter.
O He Who is nearer to me than my life-vein: 
(Please) overlook my slips,
And revive me through settling my needs.
O my Creator; O the Source of my sustenance; O my Resurrector;
O He Who shall give life to my bones when they are rotten:
(Please do) bless Mu¦ammad and the Household of Mu¦ammad,

117,Dua e Widaa,"Shaykh al-Kulayni, in his book of ‘al-Kafe’ has reported on the authority of Abu-Baser that Imam al-Jafar sadiq (a.s) instructed that the following supplication might be said for bidding the month of Ramazan farewell","O Allah: You have said in Your revealed Book: “The month of Ramadhan in which the Quran was revealed…” And this month of Ramadhan is about to slip away. I thus beseech You in the name of Your Noble Face, And Your Perfect Words, If I am still liable to a sin that You have not yet forgiven or You want to punish me for it, or to retaliate upon me because of it, (I beseech You that) before dawn of this night rises And before this moth elapses (please) forgive it for me; O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy. O Allah: all praise be to You in all expressions of praise— The first and the last expressions; Expressions that You have said about Yourself, And expressions that have been used by the created beings; The beings that are diligent, selected, Revering their mention of You, And their thanking You, Whom You helped carry out Your duty that is incumbent upon them, From among the varieties of Your creatures; Such as the Favorite Angels, The Prophets, the Messengers, And the other varieties who speak of Your praise And glorify You from among all the creatures. (Praise be to You for) You have allowed us to witness the month of Ramadhan, While we are covered by Your graces And we are enjoying Your bounties and favors And Your evident conferrals. For all that, the ultimate praise be to You, Praise that is perpetual and ceaseless And endless and eternal and everlasting Praise that never ends evermore. Splendid be the praising of You, For You have helped us accomplish our fasting and acts of worship in this month, Including prayers and whatever good deed that we have done during this month As well as all praise and mention of You. O Allah: (please) accept all that from us with the most excellent of Your approval And Your overlooking and Your pardoning And Your excusing and Your forgiving And the actuality of Your pleasure So that You may make us win all good turns that is besought And the abundant share from any gifted bestowal And that You save us from any dangerous matter, Or any anticipated misfortune Or any committed sin. O Allah: I beseech You in the name of the greatest of all these by which any of Your servants have besought You, Including Your Noble Names, And the excellent praising of You And private supplication to You That You may send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, And You may decide this month of Ramadhan to be the greatest month in blessings that we have ever witnessed Since we were sent down to this world, As regarding protection of my religion, And redemption of myself And settlement of my needs And that You may accept my intercession to You concerning Your settlement of my requests And Your perfecting Your graces upon me And Your keeping evil away from me And Your dressing me with well-being during this month, And that You may include me, out of Your mercy, with those whom You allowed to obtain the benefits of the Grand Night And those for whom You have decided this Night to be better than one thousand months, As regarding obtaining its vastest rewards, And its noblest gifts And approving praiseworthiness And obtaining long lifetime And perpetuity of comfort. O Allah: I also beseech You in the name of Your mercy and Your beneficence And Your pardon and Your graces And Your majesty and Your eternal favoring and conferral That You may not decide this month of Ramadhan to be the last one in our lifetime; Rather, You may decide us to catch the coming month of Ramadhan while we enjoy the best of manners And that You may decide us to see the new moon of the next month of Ramadhan by including me with those who will see it and realize its value While I am enjoying the best wellbeing And the most blissful of Your bounties And the most expansive of Your mercy And the most abundant of the share of Your sustenance that You decide for me. O my Lord save Whom I have no lord; (please) do not decide that this words of bidding the month of Ramadhan farewell to be the last farewell after which there will be my termination And do not decide this time to be the last of my meeting the month of Ramadhan; Rather, You may decide that You will enable me to witness the coming Ramadhan while I am enjoying the most expansive graces and attaining the best of my hopes And I am loyal to You in the most faithful manner. Verily, You are the Hearer of prayers. O Allah: (please) respond to my prayer, And have mercy upon my acquiescence and submission before You As well as my humbleness and reliance upon You, While I am totally subservient to You; I hope success and wellbeing And honoring and attainment of my hopes from none save You and through none save You; So, (please) do this favor to me— Splendid be the praising of You, And sacred be Your Names— By allowing me to witness the (coming) month of Ramadhan while I am delivered from any apprehensive and fearful matter And from all misfortunes. All praise be to Allah Who has helped us observe fasting during this month and do acts of worship Until I am witnessing the last night of this month. ",Last Night of Ramadhan,widaa.mp3,9,65,D,,,,,
118,Dua by  Imam Sajjad (as),"It is recommended to bid farewell to the month of Ramazan through the supplications dedicated to this purpose and are mentioned by al-Kulayniy, al-Saduq, al-Mufed, al-Tusiy, and Sayyid Ibn Tawus—may Allah be pleased with them all. Yet, the best supplication in this respect may be the forty-fifth supplication of the al-Sahefah al-Kamilah al-Sajjadiyyah, by Imam Ali ibn Hussain (as) which is as follows","O God, O He who desires no repayment! O He who shows no remorse at bestowal! O He who rewards not His servant tit for tat!  Thy kindness is a new beginning, Thy pardon gratuitous bounty,181 Thy punishment justice, Thy decree a choice for the best!  If Thou bestowest, Thou stainest not Thy bestowal with obligation, and if Thou withholdest, Thou withholdest not in transgression.  Thou showest gratitude to him who thanks Thee, while Thou hast inspired him to thank Thee.  Thou rewardest him who praises Thee, while though Thou hast taught him Thy praise.  Thou coverest him whom, if Thou willed, Thou wouldst expose, and Thou art generous toward him from whom, if Thou willed, Thou wouldst withhold. Both are worthy of Thy exposure and withholding, but Thou hast founded Thy acts upon gratuitous bounty, channelled Thy power into forbearance, received him who disobeyed Thee with clemency, and disregarded him who intended wrongdoing against himself. Thou awaitest their turning back without haste and refrainest from rushing them toward repentance, so that the perisher among them may not perish because of Thee and the wretched may not be wretched through Thy favour, but only after Thy prolonged excusing him and successive arguments against him, as an act of generosity through Thy pardon, O Generous, and an act of kindliness through Thy tenderness, O Clement!  It is Thou who hast opened for Thy servants a door to Thy pardon, which Thou hast named 'repentance'. Thou hast placed upon that door a pointer from Thy revelation, lest they stray from it: Thou hast said (blessed are Thy names), Repent toward God with unswerving repentance! It may be that Thy Lord will acquit of your evil deeds and will admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow, upon the day when God will not degrade the Prophet and those who have faith along with him, their light running before them and on their right hands, and they say:   'Our Lord, complete for us our light, and forgive us! Surely Thou art powerful over everything.'182 What is the excuse of him who remains heedless of entering that house after the opening of the door and the setting up of the pointer?  It is Thou who hast raised the price against Thyself to the advantage of Thy servants, desiring their profit in their trade with Thee, their triumph through reaching Thee, and their increase on account of Thee, for Thou hast said (blessed is Thy Name and high art Thou exalted), Whoso brings a good deed shall have ten the like of it, and whoso brings an evil deed shall only be recompensed the like of it.183  Thou hast said, The likeness of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains; so God multiplies unto whom He wills.184 Thou hast said, Who is he that will lend to God a good loan, and He will multiply it for him manifold?185 And Thou hast sent down in the Qur'an similar verses on the multiplying of good deeds.  It is Thou who hast pointed them through Thy speech from Thy Unseen and Thy encouragement in which lies their good fortune toward that which - hadst Thou covered it from them - their eyes would not have perceived, their ears would not have heard, and their imaginations would not have grasped,    for Thou hast said, Remember Me and I will remember you be thankful to Me, and be you not thankless towards Me!186 Thou hast said, If you are thankful, surely I will increase you, but if you are thankless, My chastisement is surely terrible;187  And Thou hast said, Supplicate Me and I will respond to you, surely those who wax too proud to worship Me shall enter Gehenna utterly abject.188 Hence Thou hast named supplicating Thee 'worship' and refraining from it 'waxing proud', and Thou hast threatened that the refraining from it would yield entrance into Gehenna in utter abjection.  So they remember Thee for Thy kindness, they thank Thee for Thy bounty, they supplicate Thee by Thy command, and they donate for Thee in order to seek Thy increase; in all this lies their deliverance from Thy wrath and their triumph through Thy good pleasure.  Were any creature himself to direct another creature to the like of that to which Thou Thyself hast directed Thy servants, he would be described by beneficence, qualified by kindness, and praised by every tongue. So to Thee belongs praise as long as there is found a way to praise Thee and as long as there remains for praising words by which Thou may be praised and meanings which may be spent in praise!  O He who shows Himself praiseworthy to His servants through beneficence and bounty, flooding them with kindness and graciousness! How much Thy favour has been spread about among us, Thy kindness lavished upon us, and Thy goodness singled out for us!  Thou hast guided us to Thy religion which Thou hast chosen, Thy creed with which Thou art pleased, and Thy path which Thou hast made smooth, and Thou hast shown us proximity to Thee and arrival at Thy generosity!  O God, among the choicest of those duties and the most special of those obligations Thou hast appointed the month of Ramadan, which Thou hast singled out from other months, chosen from among all periods and eras, and preferred over all times of the year through the Qur'an and the Light which Thou sent down within it, the faith which Thou multiplied by means of it, the fasting which Thou obligated therein, the standing in prayer which Thou encouraged at its time, and the Night of Decree which Thou magnified therein, the night which is better than a thousand months.189  Through it Thou hast preferred us over the other communities and through its excellence Thou hast chosen us to the exclusion of the people of the creeds. We fasted by Thy command in its daylight, we stood in prayer with Thy help in its night, presenting ourselves by its fasting and its standing to the mercy which Thou hast held up before us, and we found through it the means to Thy reward. And Thou art full of what is sought from Thee, munificent with what is asked of Thy bounty, and near to him who strives for Thy nearness.  This month stood among us in a standing place of praise, accompanied us with the companionship of one approved, and profited us with the most excellent profit of the world's creatures. Then it parted from us at the completion of its time, the end of its term, and the fulfilment of its number.  So we bid farewell to it with the farewell of one whose parting pains us, whose leaving fills us with gloom and loneliness, and to whom we have come to owe a safeguarded claim, an observed inviolability, and a discharged right. We say: Peace be upon thee, O greatest month of God! O festival of His friends!  Peace be upon thee, O most noble of accompanying times! O best of months in days and hours!  Peace be upon thee, month in which expectations come near and good works are scattered about!  Peace be upon thee, comrade who is great in worth when found and who torments through absence when lost, anticipated friend whose parting gives pain!  Peace be upon thee, familiar who brought comfort in coming, thus making happy, who left loneliness in going, thus giving anguish!  Peace be upon thee, neighbour in whom hearts became tender and sins became few!  Peace be upon thee, helper who aided against Satan, companion who made easy the paths of good-doing!  Peace be upon thee - How many became freedmen of God within thee! How happy those who observed the respect due to thee!  Peace be upon thee - How many the sins thou erased! How many the kinds of faults thou covered over!  Peace be upon thee - How drawn out wert thou for the sinners! How awesome wert thou in the hearts of the faithful!  Peace be upon thee, month with which no days compete!  Peace be upon thee, month which is peace in all affairs!  Peace be upon thee, thou whose companionship is not disliked, thou whose friendly mixing is not blamed!  Peace be upon thee, just as thou hast entered upon us with blessings and cleansed us of the defilement of offenses!  Peace be upon thee - Thou art not bid farewell in annoyance nor is thy fasting left in weariness!  Peace be upon thee, object of seeking before thy time, object of sorrow before thy passing!  Peace be upon thee - How much evil was turned away from us through thee! How much good flowed upon us because of thee!  Peace be upon thee and upon the Night of Decree which is better than a thousand months!190  Peace be upon thee - How much we craved thee yesterday! How intensely we shall yearn for thee tomorrow!  Peace be upon thee and upon thy bounty which has now been made unlawful to us and upon thy blessings gone by which have now been stripped away from us!  O God, we are the people of this month. Through it Thou hast ennobled us and given us success because of Thy kindness, while the wretched are ignorant of its time. Made unlawful to them is its bounty because of their wretchedness.  Thou art the patron of the knowledge of it by which Thou hast preferred us, and its prescribed practices to which Thou hast guided us. We have undertaken, through Thy giving success, its fasting and its standing in prayer, but with shortcomings, and we have performed little of much.  O God, so to Thee belongs praise, in admission of evil doing and confession of negligence, and to Thee belongs remorse firmly knitted in our hearts and seeking of pardon sincerely uttered by our tongues. Reward us, in spite of the neglect that befell us in this month, with a reward through which we may reach the bounty desired from it and win the varieties of its craved stores!  Make incumbent upon us Thy pardon for our falling short of Thy right in this month and make our lives which lie before us reach the coming month of Ramadan! Once Thou hast made us reach it, help us perform the worship of which Thou art worthy, cause us to undertake the obedience which Thou deservest, and grant us righteous works that we may fulfil Thy right in these two months of the months of time.191  O God, as for the small and large sins which we have committed in this our month, the misdeeds into which we have fallen, and the offenses which we have earned purposefully or in forgetfulness, wronging ourselves thereby or violating the respect due to others, bless Muhammad and his Household, cover us over with Thy covering, pardon us through Thy pardoning, place us not before the eyes of the gloaters because of that, stretch not toward us the tongues of the defamers, and employ us in that which will alleviate and expiate whatever Thou disapprovest from us within it through Thy clemency which does not run out, and Thy bounty which does not diminish!  O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, redress our being afflicted by our month,192 bless us in this day of our festival and our fast-breaking, make it one of the best of days that have passed over us, the greatest in attracting Thy pardon, and the most effacing toward sins, and forgive us our sins, both the concealed and the public!  O God, with the passing of this month make us pass forth from our offenses, with its departure make us depart from our evil deeds, and appoint us thereby among its most felicitous people, the most plentiful of them in portion, and the fullest of them in share!  O God,  when any person observes this month as it should be observed, safeguards its inviolability as it should be safeguarded, attends to its bounds as they should be attended to, fears its misdeeds as they should be feared, or seeks nearness to Thee with any act of nearness-seeking which makes incumbent upon him Thy good pleasure and bends toward him Thy mercy, give to us the like [of that]193 from Thy wealth and bestow it upon us in multiples through Thy bounty, for Thy bounty does not diminish, Thy treasuries do not decrease but overflow, the mines of Thy beneficence are not exhausted, and Thy bestowal is the bestowal full of delight!  O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and write for us the like of the wages of him who fasted in it or worshipped Thee within it until the Day of Resurrection!  O God, we repent to Thee in our day of fast-breaking, which Thou hast appointed for the faithful a festival and a joy and for the people of Thy creed a time of assembly and gathering, from every misdeed we did, ill work we sent ahead, or evil thought we secretly conceived, the repentance of one who does not harbour a return to sin and who afterwards will not go back to offense, an unswerving repentance rid of doubt and wavering. So accept it from us, be pleased with us, and fix us within it!  O God, provide us with fear of the threatened punishment and yearning for the promised reward, so that we may find the pleasure of that for which we supplicate Thee and the sorrow of that from which we seek sanctuary in Thee!  And place us with Thee among the repenters, those upon whom Thou hast made Thy love obligatory and from whom Thou hast accepted the return to obeying Thee!194 O Most Just of the just!  O God, show forbearance toward our fathers and our mothers and all the people of our religion, those who have gone and those who will pass by, until the Day of Resurrection!  O God, bless our prophet Muhammad and his Household, as Thou hast blessed Thy angels brought nigh, bless him and his Household, as Thou hast blessed Thy prophets sent out, bless him and his Household, as Thou hast blessed Thy righteous servants - and better than that, O Lord of the worlds! - a blessing whose benediction will reach us, whose benefit will attain to us, and through which our supplication may be granted! Thou art the most generous of those who are beseeched, the most sufficient of those in whom confidence is had, the most bestowing of those from whom bounty is asked, and Thou art powerful over everything!

O Allah make us generous, good and high-minded, more than that which they can imagine or speculate, cover and escort us with that which they know not, and do not (even) associate us with that which they say. Sufficient is Allah (for me), there is no god save He, on Him I rely, and He is the Lord of the Great Arsh. 
We believe that all is from our Lord, and do not say (this) save those who have sincere hearts and intelligent minds. Our Lord! Cause not our hearts to stray after Thou has guided us, and bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence. Verily Thou art the Bestower.",Salaat and Dua,,1,2,D,,,,,

131,Dua on day of Ashura,"Raise your hands, having in mind the enemies of “Aali Muhammad”, and say:","O my Allah! Indeed a great many among the people declared war, laid traps and intrigued against the careful and gentle guardians who observed and fulfilled the duty. The ungratefuls (the said opponents) renounced the faith and did not, in fact, believe in the “Kalimah” (LAA ILAAHA ILLALLAAH); attached themselves to the trend setters of disorder and tyranny; disowned and gave up the Book and the (Divine) rule of life; swerved from and angled off the two strings which according to Thy commandment, (they) should have held fast and stuck close by; undermined and twisted the truth; Went, away from the real purpose, in the opposite direction ; encouraged partisanship; Altered and falsified the Book; refused to believe in the evident proof and rightful clain, whenever confronted face to face; chose falsehood, whenever came across; lost their way and corrupted Thy laws, Islam; led people astray; killed the children of Thy Prophet, Thy liberal highminded servants, bearers of Thy knowledge, inheritors of Thy wisdom and revelation, the Book.
O my Allah, upset and overturn the plan and movement of Thy enemies, (who are also) the enemies of Thy Messenger and the children of Thy Messenger.
O my Allah, put a stop to the spread of their sphere of influence; make their equipment and men unserviceable, their expression confused and contradictory; break up their support; crack up their strategy; lay hold upon them, hit and cut off by Thy one sharp strike; throw them down, frightened by Thy hard unnerving barrier, bury them under the swallowing mud of disasters; let them be mean and contemptible under the yoke of despise-able penance; bring them to book and let them have the taste of a hard and sharp retribution; fester them with definite and exemplary punishment, as Thou wipes out Thy enemies; it is beyond the shadow of doubt that Thou cracks down upon the criminals. 
O my Allah, the way of life approved by Thee has been tossed aside; Thy code of law has been suspended; and the descendents of the Prophet, in this world, had been tormented. O my Allah, Therefore give all Thy attention and care to signify truth, and the upholders of truth; restrain and prevent falsehood, and the camp-followers of false-hood, and take us to safety as a favour; guide us to true faith; make available for us, as soon as possible, happiness and bliss, bring everything in to good order through the inspiring presence of Thy representatives; make us desire and love them , make them receive us with open arms.
O my Allah, bring to nothing those who celebrate the day the choicest (grand) son of Thy Prophet was martyred, in cheerful amusement; laugh and enjoy in utter delight and indulge in wanton boisterous merriment; catch hold of and punish each one of the remaining, just as Thou cracked down on the early (culprits); make twice as much the penalty, 
O my Allah, and punishment, a warning example, (while convicting0 the tyrants who took liberties with and abused the children of Thy Prophet; give the eath blow to their henchmen, put an en to their headmen, wipe out their patrons and their groups altogether. 
O my Allah, multiply Thy blessings generously, Thy mercy liberally, Thy favours like a windfall, (thou bestows) upon the children of Thy Prophet, who Thy enemies tried to ignore, frighten and corner, the children who are the blooming pride of the fragrant strongly grown and fertile tree. Let people subscribe to and uphold, 
O my Allah, their expressed refined (thoughts), and get the better of the antagonists in debate and disputations through their arguments, put the dark clouds of trouble, distress nothingness and ignorance, to flight, through (on account of) them, make firm and strong the hearts and minds of their followers (to know things for certain and give correct answers), to belong to Thy party, obedient to Thee; to love them; to support them ; stand by them, signify them; they exercised self-control whenever they put up with damage and injury in Thy cause; bring in, for them, the days, people will see them and find them among themselves to pronounce the profession of true faith, a blissful and happy time; Be quick in providing relief and joy, after a long period of suffering (to them and us), on account of their presence; bring on their worthy, decent and refined sphere of influence; and support them as Thou has given a guarantee in this connection in Thy revealed Book; Thou said, (and Thy words are always true): Allah has promised such of you as believe and do good deed that He will surely appoint them successors in the earth, as He appointed successors those before them, and that He will surely establish for them Their religion which He has chosen for them, and surely He will give them in exchange safety after their fear. Thy (shall) ascribe nothing as partner unto Me.
O my Allah! Therefore disperse the dark clouds hanging over them, no one has power to keep safe from pair and distress save He, O Unique ! O Single ! O Everliving ! O Self-subsisting!
O my Allah, Thy bondman, cautions and (always) aware of Thy just requital, turn to Thee with a request, standing before Thee, to seek the favour of taking refuge with Thee, in Thy courtyard, fully aware of the fact that there is no way to run away from Thee except unto Thee. O my Allah, accede to my request, take notice of my positive statement and heartfelt secret avowal, 
O my Allah, and let me be the one whose conduct satisfies Thee, (whose) pious life devoted to Thee receives Thy approval, (whom) Thou brings to a place of safety through Thy mercy; verily Thou art rare, dear and beloved (because of ) Thy kindness.
O my Allah, send blessings, in the beginning and at the end, on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad; keep at peace at all times, Muhammad and the children of Muhammad, let Thy love and tenderness always envelop Muhammad and the children of Muhammad, more thoroughly and decisively than Thou had blessed, kept at peace and loved Thy Prophets, Messengers, Angels and the bearers of Thy Arsh, in the name of and for the sake of “LAA ILAAHA ILLAA ANTA”.
O my Allah, let there be no separation (ever) between me and Muhammad and the children of Muhammad, Thy blessings be on him and them; let me be one among the friends and followers of Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn, and their pure and select descendants; give me the insight to cling to their friendship, and be always ready to walk with them, and make use of their life style; Verily Thou art liberal, Generous and Kind,
Now go into prostration (Sajdah), keep either side of your face on the earth, one after the other, and say):O He who decrees that which He wills, does that which He wants. It is Thou who possesses and exercises absolute power; therefore (all) praise is for Thee (only); (Thou alone art) the praiseworthy, the thankworthy.
O my Master, let them have a life full of love and peace, and let us share the harmony and bliss with them, because Thou has given a guarantee to put them on the highest pedestal of love, honour and wisdom, after the severest trial and tribulation, to do too much for them , exceeding all bounds, after they had put up with the worldly minimum (in Thy cause), to make them distinct and evident after (Thy enemies) kept them in obscurity, O the Most Truthful ! O the Most Merciful!
I beseech Thee, O my Lord, and Master, humble and weak before Thee, to throw wide open doors of Thy generosity and kindness to let my hope (of fulfillment of heart’s desires)come true, and get and ather what I want in surplus; and make valid my deeds, whether insignificant looking or weighty, prolong my days until I am satisfied with being an eye-witness, and give testimony, and be among those who are called upon, so run to obey them, love them and support them (the descendents of the Holy Prophet); Make me see that very soon, close at hand, in good health sund mind and with believing heart. Verily Thou art able to do all things (raise your head, look towards the sky and say): in Thee do I seek refuge that I should be among those who hope not for Thy “Days”, so make me full well and be there, O my Master, through Thy mercy, in that time.",After moving forward & backward,,1,6,D,,,,,

Forgive me my sins that swerve the flow of bounties. Forgive me my sins that give birth to remorse. Forgive me my sins that bring upon depression. Forgive me my sins that put asunder integrity. Forgive me my sins that nullify prayers. Forgive me my sins that hold back that which drops (mercy) from the heaven. Forgive me my sins that urge to bring quickly nothingness and non-existence. Forgive me my sins that draw near misery and distress. Forgive me my sins that bring disorder and chaos in thought and purpose. Forgive me my sins that expose and lay bare shelter and security. Forgive me my sins that no one can forgive other than Thee.  
O Allah! Take off the load (burden of sins) from my back belonging to any one from among Thy creation; make haste in my affairs, freed of care, brought into focus, and made easy; put into my heart sure and certain belief in Thee, and impress into my mind hope in and quest for Thee, till I turn to no one other than Thee. My Allah protect me, keep me safe in my position, be my constant companion in darkness and light, in (the hour of) comfort, in hardships, in success, in misfortune, in gain, in loss, make easy my course, let conduct of life be good, do not leave me in the lurch, forsaken in distress or difficulty, guide me O the Best Guide, do not let me look repeatedly at my vain desires while carrying out day to day work, let me find happiness every where, make me team up with my family, happy and successful, in this quickly passing life and at the appointed time; (there is no doubt) certainly Thou art able to do all things. Give me the provisions of life as much as Thy generosity approves, open up for me the doors of Thy plenteous, good and clean store of possessions, put me to work in Thy obedience, keep me safe from fire and fury, when I die be merciful and direct my journey to Thy Paradise. O my Allah, in Thee do I seek refuge from the disappearance of Thy bounties, from discontinuation of welfare Thou made available for me, from the torment that may come upon me, from the penalty that comes down upon (us), from the disasters that vex and molest, from the misery (and distress) that takes hold of and lingers on, from violent and painful death, from the pride and joy of the enemies, from the evil that falls down from the skies, from the evil which has been pointed out in the revealed Book. O my Allah! Do not make me be among the evildoers, nor be among the dwellers of Hell, do not keep me out of enjoyment found in the company of the good; make me live a clear and honest life, and die a tranquil death, unite me (after death) with the select pious, let me keep company with the Prophets, in the abode of good repute, near the omnipotent seat of authority. O my Allah! (All) praise is for Thee (alone), (for) Thy smooth and fair system of test and trail (so) clever and skilful. (All) praise is for Thee (alone), (for) Islam, and (making all) follow the ""way of life"" (of Muhammad (s.a.), O Lord, just as Thou had guided them to Thy religion, and taught (revealed) them Thy Book, so guide us and teach us as well. (All) praise is for Thee (alone), (for Thy smooth and fair system of test and trail (so) clever and skilful, particularly for me; just as Thou created me, (how wonderful is my creation!) and taught me, how thorough is my learning!) and showed me the right path, (how complete is the guidance I received!). (All) praise is for Thee (alone), (for) Thy bounties bestowed upon me, earlier and present. How my agonies, O my Master, Thou has dispelled! How many sorrows, O my Master, Thou has hushed! How many hardships, O my Master, Thou has put to flight! How many disasters, O my Master, Thou has dispersed! How many defects, O my Master, Thou has covered! So (all) praise is for Thee (alone), under all circumstances, in every place, at all times, in chaos, and in order, in the present moment and at all occasions. O Allah give me also from the gifts Thy deserving servants win, and duly distributed today, or the loss showed openly to them, or the evil sent away from them, or the disaster warded off from them, or the good urged on to reach them, or the mercy scattered and spread out, or the welfare that mingles and gets around, so (there is no doubt) Thou art able to do all things. In Thy hands are the treasures of the heavens and the earth. Thou art One, the Kindest Giver who does not send away one who makes a request to Him, nor disappoints one who expects to get what one wants from Him, nor there is any defect or shortage in what one obtains from Him, nor dries up and goes waste that which comes from Him, on the contrary grows more and more, (is) clean, freely given, (out of) generosity and favour.  
Give me from Thy treasures that which never get exhausted, on account of Thy merciful love and kindness; boundless and fathomless is Thy grant that neither withholds nor is inaccessible. Thou art able to do all things, through Thy mercy, O Allah! Send blessings on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad.",9th Dhu Al Hijjah - Arafah Eve ,ya_shahida.mp3,11,8,D,,,,,
141,Dua 2- Allhumma Man taaba,"Shaykh al Sayyid Ibn Tawus, al-Kaf`ami, and Sayyid Ibn Baqi have recorded that it is recommended to say the following supplicatory prayer on Fridays and at Friday nights and on the day and night of `Araf¡t (the ninth of Dhu’l-°ijjah). However, the supplication will be hereinafter cited as quoted from Shaykh al-Tusi book of al-Misbah","O my Allah! Many a man takes pain, makes compromises, uses artifices, comes to terms, to draw attention of other men in hope of profit and gain, kindness and indulgence, but unto thee, O Lord, I turn to for fitness and maturity, seeking Thy favours, making a request for Thy indulgence and kindness, because Thou does not dismiss praying suppliant. O He who does not send away any destitute disappointed; nor is ever at a disadvantage because of extravagance (giving with out restraint). Surely I have come to Thee with no good deeds to rely upon, but I never go to others to draw their attention. I have come to Thee, bitter and sour on account of vain desires, sad and desolate, ashamed of my guilt. Without any excuse or argument I have come to Thee to make a request for Thy lenient method Thou uses to deal with wrongdoers; because prolonged fascination for an artificial life does not make Thee withdraw Thy mercy. O He Who shows mercy, again and again, and forgive, ever so beyond measure. O The Magnificent! O The Magnificent! O The Magnificent! Nothing turn off thy anger except Thy loving attention; nothing keeps safe from Thy displeasure, except humble submissiveness, unto Thee. So forgive me. O my Lord and Master, free me of care and anxiety, as Thou has the skill and mastery (even) to make barren dead ground grow green, and be fertile; and do not make me rush into deadly danger, in frustration, give answer to my call, tell me that my request has received approval; let me have the full used of the welfare (I am allowed), till the end of my life. Do not give my enemy a chance to laugh at me, do not give him an upper hand over me, do not let him tread on the neck of his victim (me). O Allah! If Thou hampers my progress, who (no one) can promote my cause! If Thou improves my station, who (no one) can lower my position! It Thou condemns me who (no one) can speak to Thee on behalf of Thy servant and draw Thy attention to his plight! I know for sure there is no injustice in what Thou decides upon, nor Thou punishes in a hurry, for only he makes haste, who is liable to lose the chance, or only the weak and stupid resort to highhandedness; and Thou stands high and above, O my Lord and Master, away from this, the sublime the Greatest. O Allah! I seek refuge with Thee, so give me asylum, I look for thy protection, so watch over me. I ask for means of livelihood, so keep up me. I rely upon Thee, so make me content. I turn to thee for help against my enemy, so support me. I run after Thy help, so stand by me. I strive for Thy forgiveness, O My Lord and Master! Forgive me. So be it. So be it. So be it.",9th Dhu Al Hijjah - Arafah Eve,taabba.mp3,11,9,D,,,,,

And bless him with a blessing through other than which Thou wilt not be pleased for him, and for which Thou seest no one else worthy!  My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will pass beyond Thy good pleasure, be continuous in its continuity through Thy subsistence, and never be spent, just as Thy words will never be spent!215  My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will tie together the blessings of Thy angels, Thy prophets, Thy messengers, and those who obey Thee, comprise the blessings of Thy servants, jinn or mankind, and those worthy of Thy response, and bring together the blessings of every one of the kinds of Thy creatures which Thou hast sown and authored!  My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will encompass every blessing, bygone and new! Bless him and his Household with a blessing which is pleasing to Thee and everyone below Thee and will bring forth with all that a blessing with which Thou wilt multiply those blessings and increase them through the recurrence of days with an increasing in multiples which none can count but Thou!  My Lord, bless the best of his Household, those whom Thou hast chosen for Thy command, appointed the treasurers of Thy knowledge, the guardians of Thy religion, Thy vicegerents in Thy earth, and Thy arguments against Thy servants, purified from uncleanness and defilement through a purification by Thy desire,216 and made the mediation to Thee217 and the road to Thy Garden!  My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which makes plentiful Thy gifts and generosity, perfects for them Thy bestowals and awards, and fills out their share of Thy kindly acts and benefits!  My Lord, bless him and his Household with a blessing whose first has no term, whose term has no limit, and whose last has no utmost end!  My Lord, bless them to the weight of Thy Throne and all below it, the amount that fills the heavens and all above them, the number of Thy earths and all below and between them, a blessing that will bring them near to Thee in proximity, please Thee and them, and be joined to its likes forever!  O God, surely Thou hast confirmed Thy religion in all times with an Imam whom Thou hast set up as a guidepost to Thy servants and a lighthouse in Thy lands, after his cord has been joined to Thy cord! Thou hast appointed him the means to Thy good pleasure, made obeying him obligatory, cautioned against disobeying him, and commanded following his commands, abandoning his prohibitions, and that no forward-goer go ahead of him or back-keeper keep back from him!218 So he is the preservation of the shelter-seekers, the cave of the faithful, the handhold of the adherents, and the radiance of the worlds!  O God, so inspire Thy guardian219 to give thanks for that in which Thou hast favoured him, inspire us with the like concerning him, grant him an authority from Thee to help him,220 open for him an easy opening,221 aid him with Thy mightiest pillar, brace up his back,222 strengthen his arm,223 guard him with Thy eye, defend him with Thy safeguarding, help him with Thy angels, and assist him with Thy most victorious troops!224  Through him establish Thy Book, Thy bounds, Thy laws, and the norms of Thy Messenger's Sunna (Thy blessings, O God, be upon him and his Household), bring to life the guideposts of Thy religion, deadened by the wrongdoers, burnish the rust of injustice from Thy way, sift the adversity from Thy road, eliminate those who deviate from Thy path, and erase those who seek crookedness in Thy straightness!  Make his side mild toward Thy friends, stretch forth his hand over Thy enemies, give us his clemency, his mercy, his tenderness, his sympathy, and make us his hearers and obeyers, strivers toward his good pleasure, assistants in helping him and defending him, and brought near through that to Thee and Thy Messenger (Thy blessings, O God, be upon him and his Household).  O God, and bless the friends [of the Imams], the confessors of their station, the keepers to their course, the pursuers of their tracks, the clingers to their handhold, the adherents to their guardianship,225 the followers of their imamate, the submitters to their command, the strivers to obey them, the awaiters of their days, the directors of their eyes toward them, with blessings blessed, pure, growing, fresh, and fragrant!    Give them and their spirits peace, bring together their affair in reverential fear, set right their situations, turn toward them, Surely Thou art Ever-turning, All-compassionate226 and the Best of forgivers, and place us with them in the Abode of Peace,227 through Thy mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful!  O God, this is the Day of 'Arafa, a day which Thou hast made noble, given honour, and magnified. Within it Thou hast spread Thy mercy, showed kindness through Thy pardon, and made plentiful Thy giving, and by it Thou hast been bounteous toward Thy servants.  I am Thy servant whom Thou favoured before creating him and after creating him. Thou madest him one of those whom Thou guided to Thy religion, gavest success in fulfilling Thy right, preserved through Thy cord, included within Thy party, and directed aright to befriend Thy friends and show enmity to Thine enemies.  Then Thou commanded him, but he did not follow Thy commands, Thou restricted Him, but he did not heed Thy restrictions, Thou prohibited him from disobedience toward Thee, but he broke Thy command by doing what Thou hadst prohibited, not in contention with Thee, nor to display pride toward Thee; on the contrary, his caprice228 called him to that which Thou hadst set apart and cautioned against, and he was helped in that by Thy enemy and his enemy. So he went ahead with it knowing Thy threat, hoping for Thy pardon, and relying upon Thy forbearance, though he was the most obligated of Thy servants - given Thy kindness toward him - not to do so.  Here I am, then, before Thee, despised, lowly, humble, abject, fearful, confessing the dreadful sins with which I am burdened and the great offenses that I have committed, seeking sanctuary in Thy forgiveness, asking shelter in Thy mercy, and certain that no sanctuary-giver will give me sanctuary from Thee and no withholder will hold me back from Thee.  So act kindly toward me, just as Thou actest kindly by Thy shielding him who commits sins, be munificent toward me, just as Thou art munificent by pardoning him who throws himself before Thee, and show kindness to me, just as it is nothing great for Thee to show kindness by forgiving him who expectantly hopes in Thee!  Appoint for me in this day an allotment through which I may attain a share of Thy good pleasure, and send me not back destitute of that with which Thy worshipers return from among Thy servants!  Though I have not forwarded the righteous deeds which they have forwarded, I have forwarded the profession of Thy Unity and the negation from Thee of opposites, rivals, and likenesses, I have come to Thee by the gateways by which Thou hast commanded that people come, and I have sought nearness to Thee through that without seeking nearness through which none gains nearness to Thee.  Then I followed all this with repeated turning toward Thee, lowliness and abasement before Thee, opinion of Thee, and trust in what is with Thee; and to that I coupled hope in Thee, since the one who hopes in Thee is seldom disappointed!  I asked Thee with the asking of one vile, lowly, pitiful, poor, fearful, seeking sanctuary; all that in fear and pleading seeking refuge and asking shelter, not presumptuous through the pride of the proud, nor exalting myself with the boldness of the obedient, nor presumptuous of the intercession of the interceders.  For I am still the least of the least and the lowliest of the lowly, like a dust mote or less! O He who does not hurry the evildoers nor restrain those living in ease!229 O He who shows kindness through releasing the stumblers and gratuitous bounty through respiting the offenders!  I am the evildoer, the confessor, the offender, the stumbler!  I am he who was audacious toward Thee as one insolent!  I am he who disobeyed Thee with forethought!  I am he who hid myself from Thy servants and blatantly showed myself to Thee!230  I am he who was awed by Thy servants and felt secure from Thee!  I am he who dreaded not Thy penalty and feared not Thy severity!  I am the offender against himself!  I am the hostage to his own affliction!  I am short in shame!  I am long in suffering!  By the right of him whom Thou hast distinguished among Thy creation and by him whom Thou hast chosen for Thyself! By the right of him whom Thou hast selected from among Thy creatures and by him whom Thou hast picked for Thy task! By the right of him the obeying of whom Thou hast joined to obeying Thee, and by him the disobeying of whom Thou hast made like disobeying Thee! And by the right of him whose friendship Thou hast bound to Thy friendship and by him whose enmity Thou hast linked to Thine enmity! Shield me in this day of mine, by that through which Thou shieldest him who prays fervently to Thee while disavowing and him who seeks refuge in Thy forgiveness while repenting!  Attend to me with that through which Thou attendest to the people of obedience toward Thee, proximity to Thee, and rank with Thee!  Single me out, as Thou singlest him out who fulfils Thy covenant, fatigues himself for Thy sake alone, and exerts himself in Thy good pleasure!  Take me not to task for my neglect in respect to Thee, my transgressing the limit in Thy bounds, and stepping outside Thy ordinances!  Draw me not on little by little by granting me a respite,231 like the drawing on little by little of him who withholds from me the good he has by not sharing with Thee in letting favour down upon me!  Arouse me from the sleep of the heedless, the slumber of the prodigal, and the dozing of the forsaken!  Take my heart to that in which Thou hast employed the devout, enthralled the worshipers, and rescued the remiss!  Give me refuge from that which will keep me far from Thee, come between me and my share from Thee, and bar me from that which I strive for in Thee!  Make easy for me the road of good deeds toward Thee, racing to them from where Thou hast commanded, and coveting them as Thou desirest!  Efface me not along with those whom Thou effacest for thinking lightly of what Thou hast promised!  Destroy me not with those whom Thou destroyest for exposing themselves to Thy hate!  Annihilate me not among those whom Thou annihilatest for deviating from Thy roads!  Deliver me from the floods of trial, save me from the gullets of affliction, and grant me sanctuary from being seized by respite!232  Come between me and the enemy who misguides me, the caprice which ruins me, and the failing which overcomes me!  Turn not away from me with the turning away in wrath from one with whom Thou art not pleased!  Let me not lose heart in expecting from Thee, lest I be overcome by despair of Thy mercy!  Grant me not that which I cannot endure, lest Thou weighest me down with the surplus of Thy love which Thou loadest upon me!  Send me not from Thy hand, the sending of him who possesses no good, toward whom Thou hast no need, and who turns not back [to Thee]!  Cast me not with the casting of him who has fallen from the eye of Thy regard and been wrapped in degradation from Thee! Rather take my hand [and save me] from the falling of the stumblers, the disquiet of the deviators, the slip of those deluded, and the plight of the perishers!  Release me from that with which Thou hast afflicted the ranks of Thy servants and handmaids and make me reach the utmost degrees of him about whom Thou art concerned, towards whom Thou showest favour, and with whom Thou art pleased, so that Thou lettest him live as one praiseworthy and takest him to Thee as one felicitous!  Collar me with the collar of abstaining from that which makes good deeds fail and takes away blessings!  Impart to my heart restraint before ugly works of evil and disgraceful misdeeds!  Divert me not by that which I cannot reach except through Thee from doing that which alone makes Thee pleased with me!233  Root out from my heart the love of this vile world, which keeps from everything which is with Thee, bars from seeking the mediation to Thee,234 and distracts from striving for nearness to Thee!  Embellish for me solitude in prayer whispered to Thee by night and by day!  Give me a preservation which will bring me close to dread of Thee, cut me off from committing things made unlawful by Thee, and spare me from captivation by dreadful sins!  Give me purification from the defilement of disobedience, take away from me the filth of offenses, dress me in the dress of Thy well-being, cloak me in the cloak of Thy release, wrap me in Thy ample favours, and clothe me in Thy bounty and Thy graciousness!  Strengthen me with Thy giving success and Thy pointing the right way, help me toward righteous intention, pleasing words, and approved works, and entrust me not to my force and my strength in place of Thy force and Thy strength!  Degrade me not on the day Thou raisest me up to meet Thee, disgrace me not before Thy friends, make me not forget remembering Thee, take not away from me thanking Thee, but enjoin it upon me in states of inattention when the ignorant are heedless of Thy boons, and inspire me to laud what Thou hast done for me and confess to what Thou hast conferred upon me!  Place my beseeching Thee above the beseeching of the beseechers and my praise of Thee above the praise of the praisers!  Abandon me not with my neediness for Thee, destroy me not for what I have done for Thee,235 and slap not my brow with that with which Thou slappest the brow of those who contend with Thee, for I am submitted to Thee. I know that the argument is Thine, that Thou art closest to bounty, most accustomed to beneficence, worthy of reverent fear, and worthy of forgiveness,236 that Thou art closer to pardoning than to punishing, and that Thou art nearer to covering over than to making notorious!  Let me live an agreeable life that will tie together what I want and reach what I love while I not bring what Thou dislikest and not commit what Thou hast prohibited; and make me die the death of him whose light runs before him and on his right hand!237  Abase me before Thyself and exalt me before Thy creatures, lower me when I am alone with Thee and raise me among Thy servants, free me from need for him who has no need of me and increase me in neediness and poverty toward Thee!  Give me refuge from the gloating of enemies, the arrival of affliction, lowliness and suffering! Shield me in what Thou seest from me, the shielding of him who would have power over violence had he no clemency, and would seize for misdeeds had he no lack of haste!  When Thou desirest for a people a trial or an evil, deliver me from it, for I seek Thy shelter; and since Thou hast not stood me in the station of disgrace in this world of Thine, stand me not in such a station in the next world of Thine!  Couple for me the beginnings of Thy kindnesses with their ends and the ancient of Thy benefits with the freshly risen! Prolong not my term with a prolonging through which my heart will harden!238 Strike me not with a striking that will take away my radiance!239 Visit me not with a meanness that will diminish my worth or a decency that will keep my rank unknown!  Frighten me not with a fright by which I will despair or a terror through which I will dread, but make me stand in awe of Thy threat, take precautions against Thy leaving no excuses240 and Thy warning, and tremble at the recitation of Thy verses!  Fill my night with life by keeping me awake therein for worshipping Thee, solitude with vigil for Thee, exclusive devotion to reliance upon Thee, setting my needs before Thee, and imploring that Thou wilt set my neck free from the Fire and grant me sanctuary from Thy chastisement, within which its inhabitants dwell!  Leave me not blindly wandering in my insolence241 or inattentive in my perplexity for a time,242 make me not an admonition to him who takes admonishment, a punishment exemplary for him who takes heed, a trial for him who observes, devise not against me along with those against whom Thou devisest, replace me not with another, change not my name,243 transform not my body,244 appoint me not a mockery for Thy creatures, a laughing-stock for Thyself, a follower of anything but Thy good pleasure, a menial servant for anything but avenging Thee!  Let me find the coolness of Thy pardon and the sweetness of Thy mercy, Thy repose, Thy ease, and the garden of Thy bliss!245 Let me taste, through some of Thy boundless plenty, the flavour of being free for what Thou lovest and striving in what brings about proximity with Thee and to Thee, and give me a gift from among Thy gifts!  Make my commerce profitable246 and my return without loss,247 fill me with fear of Thy station, make me yearn for the meeting with Thee, and allow me to repent with an unswerving repentance along with which Thou lettest no sins remain, small or large, and leavest no wrongs, open or secret!  Root out rancour toward the faithful from my breast,248 bend my heart toward the humble, be toward me as Thou art toward the righteous, adorn me with the adornment of the godfearing, appoint for me a goodly report249 among those yet to come and a growing remembrance among the later folk, and take me to the plain of those who came first!250  Complete the lavishness of Thy favour upon me, clothe me in its repeated generosities, fill my hand with Thy benefits, drive Thy generous gifts to me, make me the neighbour of the best of Thy friends in the Gardens which Thou hast adorned for Thy chosen, and wrap me in Thy noble presents in the stations prepared for Thy beloveds!  Appoint for me a resting place with Thee where I may seek haven in serenity, and a resort to which I may revert and rest my eyes, weigh not against me my dreadful misdeeds, destroy me not on the day the secrets are tried,251 eliminate from me every doubt and uncertainty, appoint for me a way in the truth from every mercy, make plentiful for me the portions of gifts from Thy granting of awards, and fill out for me the shares of beneficence from Thy bestowal of bounty!  Make my heart trust in what is with Thee and my concern free for what is Thine, employ me in that in which Thou employest Thy pure friends, drench my heart with Thy obedience when intellects are distracted, and combine within me independence, continence, ease, release, health, plenty, tranquillity, and well being!  Make not fail my good deeds through my disobedience that stains them or my private times of worship through the instigations of Thy trial! Safeguard my face from asking from anyone in the world, and drive me far from begging for that which is with the ungodly!  Make me not an aid to the wrongdoers, nor their hand and helper in erasing Thy Book! Defend me whence I know not with a defense through which Thou protectest me! Open toward me the gates of Thy repentance, Thy mercy, Thy clemency, and Thy boundless provision! Surely I am one of those who beseech Thee! And complete Thy favour toward me! Surely Thou art the best of those who show favour!  Place the rest of my life in the hajj and the 'umra seeking Thy face, O Lord of the worlds! And may God bless Muhammad and his Household, the good, the pure, and peace be upon him and them always and forever! ",By Imam Zain Al Abideen (as),arafah_imam_zain.mp3,11,12,D,,,,,

148,Ziarat Jamea,"All¡mah al-Majlis¢, in his book of Tuhfat al-Zair, has listed the following comprehensive form of ziy¡rah as the eighth, saying: This form of ziy¡rah has been reported by Sayyid Ibn Tawus within the  prayers of the `Arafah Day from Imam al-¯¡diq, peace be upon him. It can be said at visiting any shrine at any time, especially on the Arafah Day.","Peace be with you, O the Messenger of Allah! Peace be with you, O the Prophet of Allah ! Peace be with you, O he who is chosen by, Allah as the most select of men; And the custodian of His revelations! Peace be with you, O my Mawlaa! O Leader – in – Chief of the faithfuls ! Peace be with you, O my Mawlaa!  You are the decisive argument of Allah over the mankind, the (only authorized)gate (passage)unto His wisdom, the executor of His Prophet’s will, his successor, after him, among his followers; may Allah curse and damn the people who usurped your rights, made a stand against you and then deserted, and I separate myself from them and their followers to take refuge with you,    Peace be with you, O Fatimah, free from worldly and sensuous concerns! Peace be with you, O the pride of the whole womankind!  Peace be with you, O daughter of the messenger of Allah, the Lord of the worlds, (Allah’s blessings be on you and him)!  Peace be with you, O the mother of Hasan and Husayn!

Peace be with you, O my Mawlaa!  O Aba Muhammad, Hasan, the pure and just who gave his wealth to the poor !  Peace be with you , O my Mawlaa!

151,Dua for Eid Al Adha Day,(Supplication - 48) His Supplication on the Day of Sacrifice (Idd uz Zuha) and on Friday  ,"O God,  this is a blessed and fortunate day,  within which the Muslims are gathered  in the quarters of Thy earth.  Among them are present the asker, the seeker,  the beseecher, the fearful,  while Thou art looking upon their needs.  So I ask Thee by Thy munificence and generosity  and easy upon Thee is what I ask Thee! -  that Thou blessest Muhammad and his Household.    And I ask Thee, O God, our Lord -  for Thine is the kingdom and Thine is the praise;  there is no god but Thou,  the Clement, the Generous,  the All-loving, the All-kind,  Possessor of majesty and munificence,  Originator of the heavens and the earth -  whenever Thou apportionest among Thy faithful servants  good, well being,  blessing, guidance,  works in obedience to Thee,  or good through which  Thou art kind to them by guiding them to Thee,  or raisest them up a degree with Thee,  or givest them the good of this world or the next,  that Thou givest me amply my share and allotment of it.    And I ask Thee, O God -  for Thine is the kingdom and the praise;  there is no god but Thou -  that Thou blessest Muhammad,  Thy servant and Thy messenger,  Thy beloved and Thy selected friend,  Thy chosen from among Thy creation,  and the Household of Muhammad,  the pious, the pure, the chosen,  with a blessing no one has strength to count but Thou,  that Thou associatest us with  the most righteous of Thy faithful servants  who supplicate Thee today - O Lord of the worlds!— and that Thou forgivest us and them!  Surely Thou art powerful over everything.253    O God,  toward Thee I aim with my need  and before Thee I set my poverty, my neediness, my misery,  for I have more trust in Thy forgiveness and Thy mercy  than in my own works.  Thy forgiveness and Thy mercy are vaster than my sins.  So bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,  and attend to the accomplishment of every need of mine through  Thy power over it,  its easiness for Thee,  my poverty toward Thee,  and Thy freedom from need for me!  I will come upon no good whatsoever unless through Thee,  no one other than Thou will turn any evil away from me,  and I have hope in none but Thee for my affair  in the next world and in this world.    O God,  if anyone has ever  arranged,  made ready,  prepared,  and drawn himself up  to be received by a creature  in hope of his support and awards,  then today toward Thee, my Master, is  my arrangement,  my making ready,  my preparation,  and my drawing up,  in hope of Thy pardon and support  and in seeking to attain to Thee and Thy prize.    O God,  so bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad  and disappoint not my hope in that today!  O He who is not troubled by those who ask  and diminished by those who attain their desire!  I come not before Thee trusting  in a righteous work I have sent ahead,  nor in the intercession of any creature in whom  I have hope,  except the intercession of Muhammad  and the Folk of his House  (upon him and upon them be Thy peace).    I come to Thee admitting sin and evildoing toward myself.  I come to Thee hoping for Thy abounding pardon  through which Thou hast pardoned the offenders,  while their long persistence in dreadful sin  did not prevent Thee  from returning toward them with mercy and forgiveness!    O He whose mercy is wide  and whose pardon is abounding!  O All-mighty!  O All-mighty!  O All-generous!  O All-generous!  Bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,  return toward me through Thy mercy,  be tender toward me through Thy bounty,  and spread out Thy forgiveness upon me!    O God,  this station belongs to Thy vicegerents, Thy chosen,  while the places of Thy trusted ones  in the elevated degree which Thou hast singled out for them  have been forcibly stripped!254  But Thou art the Ordainer of that -  Thy command is not overcome,  the inevitable in Thy governing is not overstepped!  However Thou willest and whenever Thou willest!  In that which Thou knowest best,  Thou art not accused for Thy creation or Thy will!  Then Thy selected friends, Thy vicegerents,  were overcome, vanquished, forcibly stripped;  they see Thy decree replaced,  Thy Book discarded,  Thy obligations distorted from the aims of Thy laws,  and the Sunna of Thy Prophet abandoned!    O God,  curse their enemies among those of old and the later folk,  and all those pleased with their acts,  and their adherents and followers!    O God,  bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad  (surely Thou art All-laudable, All-glorious)  like Thy blessing, benedictions, and salutations  upon Thy chosen Abraham and the people of Abraham!  And hasten for them relief,  ease,  help,  strengthening,  and confirmation!    O God,  and make me  one of the people who profess Thy Unity,  have faith in Thee,  and attest to Thy Messenger  and the Imams toward whom Thou hast enjoined obedience,  and one of those through whom and at whose hands  this takes place!255  Amen, Lord of the worlds!    O God,  nothing repels Thy wrath but Thy clemency,  nothing repels Thy displeasure but Thy pardon,  nothing grants sanctuary from Thy punishment but  Thy mercy,  and nothing will deliver me from Thee  except pleading to Thee before Thee,256  so bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,  and give us on Thy part, my God, relief by means of the power  through which Thou bringest the dead servants to life  and revivest the dead lands.257    Destroy me not through gloom, my God,  before Thou respondest to me  and givest me the knowledge of Thy response to  my supplication!  Let me taste the flavour of well-being to the end of my term!  And let not my enemy gloat over me,  place not my neck in his power,  and give him not authority over me!    My God,  if Thou raisest me up,  who is there to push me down?  If Thou pushest me down,  who is there to raise me up?  If Thou honourest me,  who is there to humiliate me?  If Thou humiliatest me,  who is there to honour me?  If Thou chastisest me,  who is there to have mercy upon me?  If Thou destroyest me,  who is there to stand up for Thy servant against Thee  or ask Thee about his affair?  But I know that there is no wrong in Thy decree  and no hurry in Thy vengeance.  He alone hurries who fears to miss,  and only the weak needs to wrong.  But Thou art exalted, my God,  high indeed above all that!    O God,  bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,  make me not the target of affliction  nor the object of Thy vengeance,  respite me,  comfort me,  release me from my stumble,  and afflict me not with an affliction  in the wake of an affliction,  for Thou hast seen my frailty,  the paucity of my stratagems,  and my pleading to Thee!    I seek refuge in Thee today, my God, from Thy wrath,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and give me refuge!    I seek sanctuary in Thee today from Thy displeasure,  so bless Muhammad and his Household,  and give me sanctuary!    I ask Thee security from Thy chastisement,  so bless Muhammad and his Household,  and give me security!    I seek guidance from Thee,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and guide me!    I seek help from Thee,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and help me!    I ask Thee for mercy,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and have mercy upon me!    I seek sufficiency from Thee,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and suffice me!    I seek provision from Thee,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and provide for me!    I seek assistance from Thee,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and assist me!    I pray forgiveness for my past sins,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and forgive me!    I ask Thee to preserve me from sin,  so bless Muhammad and his Household  and preserve me,  for I will not return to anything Thou dislikest from me,  if Thou willest that!    My Lord!  My Lord!  O All-loving!  O All-kind!  O Possessor of majesty and munificence!  Bless Muhammad and his Household,  and grant me everything that I  ask from Thee,  seek from Thee,  and beseech from Thee!  Will it, ordain it, decree it, and accomplish it!  Give me good in that of it which Thou decreest!  Bless me in that,  be gratuitously bountiful toward me through it,  make me happy in that of it which Thou givest to me,  and increase me in Thy bounty  and the plenty of what is with Thee,  for Thou art Boundless, Generous!  And link that to the good and the bliss of the next world,  O Most Merciful of the merciful! ",By Imam Zain Al Abideen (as),imam_zain_eid.mp3,11,19,D,,,,,

        Slaughtering an animal (qurbani) in other places is emphasized practice (sunnat-e-muwakkida). If the animal of sacrifice is camel or cow, it must be a female. If it is a ram or a goat it must be male. The camel should have entered its sixth year. In cow and goat the precaution is that it should have entered the third year. Sheep must have entered the second year. The sacrificial animal must not have any damaged part. That it must not have a broken horn or cut ear. Sacrifice of castrated animal and ones raised as domestic animals, is detestable (makrooh). At the time of offering the sacrifice, say:</p>

        The Hajj pilgrims have to slaughter an animal in the Holy Mecca with obligatory intention and if a Haji is not having the means to do so he must keep ten fasts. Three fast in Mecca and seven after returning home.The animal be slaughtered by the pilgrim himself but if he cannot, he should hold the knife in his hand and the person slaughtering the animal should hold the hand of the pilgrim; there is no objection to the pilgrim holding the hand of the person slaughtering the animal.

163,Meeting with Brothers In Faith,At the time of meeting with the brothers-in-faith say the following:,"Praise be to Allah, who blessed us to be among -those who cling and hold to the ""Wilayaat"" (love, friendship and authority) of Ameer Al Momineen and all the Imams, peace be on them all.
AND
Praise be to Allah who honored us with this day, and included us among those who have been given all that which was promised to them, and have been tied together with the bonds of contract to have full confidence in the authority of the guardians of the religious laws who established justice; and did not disgrace us to be among those who know better but deny the truth and treat the Day of Judgment as a false fable.",On Ghadir Day (18 Dhu Al Hijjah),,11,31,D,,,,,
164,Allamumma inni asaloka be anna lakal hamda wahdaka,Dua for Eid Ghadir,"O Allah I beseech Thee (alone), because, verily, to Thee belongs (all) praise; Thou art Single, has no partner, One, Unique, eternally besought Independent, neither begets, nor begotten, and there is none comparable unto Thee; and Muhammad is Thy servant and Messenger, Thy blessings be on him and on his children. 
O He who, every day, exercises (universal) power, so (it was) under Thy mandate I was taken care of, and because of which I am among those who receive Thy response, follow thy religion, and call Thee (alone).
Thou assisted me like this right from the day I was born, through Thy favours, generosity and kindness, thereafter, Thy favours followed one another in succession, and likewise, also Thy rewards and mercy, in such a manner that Thou, again and again, kept (the uninterrupted flow of favours, rewards and bounties) reactivated since my birth. 
May be I was slow, forgetful, neglectful, careless and indolent, but Thou completed Thy favours, and always thought of me in this connection (granting of favours), bestowed them on me, directed me into their direction, so by Thy power it is as it should be O my God, Master, and Lord, Thou brought (Thy favours) to fullness, did not withdraw (any blessing), till I breathed my last amid those (advantages), Thou was pleased with me, verily Thou art the worthiest of all who grant favours, and it is Thou who perfected Thy bounties for me. 
O Allah we paid attention, obeyed, and responded to Thy call, (and it was also Thy favour to us) therefore, praise is for Thee (alone), we seek Thy pardon O our Lord, and unto Thee we shall return. We believe in ""One Allah who has no partner"", and in His Messenger, Muhammad, blessings of Allah be on him and on his children. 
We stand up for and comply with Allah's command, and follow the example of the Messenger in the matter of Love and friendship to our ""Mawlaa"" and ""Mawlaa"" of the believers, the commander of the faithfuls, Ali ibna abi Taalib, the servant of Allah, the brother of His Messenger, the renowned truthful, the decisive argument over mankind, through whom, the Almighty helped and supported His Prophet and His manifest true religion, the sign (pattern) of the divine system of life, approved by Allah, the all-aware custodian of His wisdom, the repository (being absorbed by the contemplation) of transcendental things, the depository of Allah's secrets, the confidant whom Allah trusted wholly with the affairs of all that which has been created by Him, the witness who bore witness to Him in the midst of His creation.
O Allah, our Lord - Nourisher, verily we have heard a ""crier"" calling unto faith: ""Believe you in your Lord!"" So we believed. Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and make us die the death of the righteous. 
Our Lord! And give us that which Thou has promised to us by Thy Messengers, confound us not on the Day of Judgment, verily, Thou does not break the tryst (promise to answer him who prays).
So, O our Lord, it was Thy kindness and a favour that we acted in answer to Thy call and do exactly as Thy Messenger did, taking his words as true, which proves our belief that (Ali) is the ""Mawlaa"" of (all) the believers: and we also denied and rejected ""Jibt"" and ""Taghoot"", the idols representing ignorance and let he (Ali) be our ""most loving guardian"", acceptance of whose authority (wilayat) has distinguished us, and raise us on the occasion of ""the last judgment"" in the company of our Imams' for this reason we believe in them, rely on them, and obey them.
Whether alone, or in public, we are certain of them; (we have total faith in them) under all circumstances, in their absence, during their lifetime, in the event of their death. 
We are happy to have them as our guides and leaders, they are sufficient for us as a link between us and Allah, in exclusion of others, we do not accept any one in exchange as their substitute, nor take to any one, except them, for intimate friendship.
We turn to Allah, disassociating ourselves from the group of men and jinn who carried on hostilities against them in every age. We deny and reject Jibt, Taghoot and the four idols, (and condemn) their henchmen and their followers, and every one, man or jin, who at any time, till eternity, patronize them (the idols), 
O Allah we request Thee to be our witness that we were upright and firm in religion in the light of that which Muhammad and his children had set forth, blessings of Allah be on him and on them; our opinion agrees with that which they declared reasonable, our approach to religion is exactly the same which they taught by practice, whatever they said we say, we cherish that which they held dear, we deny that which they denied, we are fond of whomsoever they loved, we hold as an enemy whomsoever they opposed, we condemn whomsoever they censured, we detest whomsoever they disliked, we are kind to whomsoever they treated with kindness. We believe in, submit to, agree with, and follow in the footsteps of our masters, blessings of Allah be on them,
O Allah keep us in this condition for ever, never withdraw it from us, let it stay stable with us, not as a passing phase. Keep us alive always in this manner so far we are kept alive, make us die likewise when the time comes: ""Aali Muhammad"", our Imams, so following them as an example, befriending them only, being hostile to their enemies, who in fact are Thy enemies, therefore, let us be with them, in this world and in the Hereafter, and be among the favourites, because this alone will given us happiness, O the Most Merciful of all who show mercy!",Dua for Eid Ghadir,ghadirdua.mp3,11,32,D,,,,,
165,Dua 2 from Mafatih    ,Dua 2  for Ghadir from Mafatih,"O Allah, I beseech You in the name of Muhammad, Your Prophet,in the name of `Ali, Your Representative (wali),and in the name of the stature and standing that You have given exclusively to them rather than Your other creatures,to send blessings to Muhammad and `Ali and begin with both of them in any immediate item of goodness.
O Allah, (please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad;the Imams, the leaders,the promulgators (to You), the masters,the shining stars,the splendid signs,the governors of the servants (of You),the pillars of the countries,the (like of the) she-camel that was sent by You,and the ark that saves (from sinking in straying off from the right path)and runs peacefully in the depths of oceans.
O Allah, (please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad;the keepers of Your knowledge,the pillars of the professing of Your Oneness,the supports of Your religion,the cores of Your honoring,the choicest among Your creatures,the best of Your beings,the pious, the pure,the outstanding, the virtuous,and the door that is decided as trial for people—he who comes through it shall be savedbut he who rejects it shall fail indeed.
O Allah, (please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad;the People of the Reminder whom You have ordered us to ask (when we do not know),the near relatives (of the Holy Prophet) whom You have ordered us to love,whose rights You have made incumbent (upon us),and whom You have decided Paradise as the reward of whoever follows their patterns.
O Allah, (please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad as they instructed (us) to obey You,warned (us) against disobeying You,and led Your servants to Your Oneness.
O Allah, I beseech You in the name of Muhammad;Your Prophet, Your superior servant,Your choice, Your trusted one,Your messenger to Your creatures;and (I beseech You) in the name of the Commander of the Believers (Am¢r al-Mu'min¢n),the chief of the religion,the leader of the white-faced and marked on the foreheads,the faithful, the loyal,the greatest veracious,the distinguisher between the right and the wrong,the witness for You,the guide to You,the expounder of what You have commanded,the striver in Your way,and who never listened to any word of blame for Your sake;
(I beseech You) to send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,to include me on this dayon which You established the pledge to Your Representative in the necks of Your servants and You thus perfected the religion for them,(to include me) with those who recognize the actual sanctity of him and those who acknowledge his precedence, and to include me with those whom You decide to release from Hellfire.(Please) do not let those who envy the bounties (that You confer upon certain persons) rejoice at my misfortunes.
O Allah, as You have made this day Your greatest feast day, You have named it “the Day of the Promised Covenant” in the heavens, and You have named it “the Day of the Exacted Covenant and the Witnessed Crowd” in the earth,(please do) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, give us delight of our eyes through him, reunify us through him,do not mislead us after You have guided us to the right path,and make us of those who thank Your bounties.
O most Merciful of all those who show mercy! All praise be to Allah Who has made us recognize the merit of this day, attracted our attentions to its sanctity, honored us on it, ennobled us through our recognition of it,and guided us through its light.
O Messenger of Allah!O Commander of the Believers! Upon you, your household, and your followers be the most excellent peace so long as night and day endure.Through you both do I direct toward Allah, my Lord and Your Lord,(and I beseech Him) to respond to my requests,settle my needs,and make easy all my affairs.
O Allah, I beseech You in the name of Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad to bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and curse whoever denies the holiness of this day and denies its sanctity; thus, he hindered from Your way intending to extinguish Your light,but Allah will not consent save to perfect His light.
O Allah, (please do) relieve misfortunes from the Household of Muhammad, Your Prophet and relieve the anguishes of them and of the believers through them. O Allah, (please do) fill the earth with justice through them just as it has been full with injustice and unfairness, and (please do) fulfill Your promise to them, for You surely do not break Your promises.",For Eid Ghadir,ghadir_dua2.mp3,11,33,D,,,,,
