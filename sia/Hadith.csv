Because accepting a post from an oppressor will result in the trampling of rights, the manifestation of injustice, the spread of corruption and disturbance, the destruction of heavenly books, the murder of Prophets, the demolishing of mosques and the interpolation of religious laws.

He thought that the only way to repent was to send back whoever comes to him for seeking orders. Next time people came to him, he told them that what he had told was false and the religion they were following was created by him. His followers were not ready to believe him and said, ""No, your religion is a true one. It is only that you have started doubting it and want to leave it."" That person nailed a chain to ground and tied it around his neck and said, ""I will remain in this condition till Allah forgives me."" The Almighty Allah sent one of His prophets to him and conveyed the message that He swears by His honor that He is not going to forgive that person even if he repents so much that the joints of his body are separated.

He waited till the Imam (a.s.) concluded his prayers. Then he started supplicating to Lord, ""O Lord! You have granted us special ranks and gave us permission to intercede. You gave us the knowledge of prophets and made their inheritors. You ended the time of past communities when we arrived. You made us successors of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and gave us the knowledge of past and future and directed the hearts of people towards us. Forgive my brothers and the visitors of Imam Husain (a.s.) and forgive those who spend their wealth and leave their homeland and come for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.). They have come to seek goodness from us, reward from You, to meet us, to make Your Messenger (s.a.w.s.) glad. They have come to obey our orders while they wanted to make Your Messenger (s.a.w.s.) happy by doing this. O Allah! Grant them our pleasure for this deed. Protect them day and night; safeguard their family and children whom they have left behind in their homeland. Keep them safe of every oppressor, enemy   weak or strong, mischief of Jinn or men. Grant them much more than they expect from You. When they were coming towards us leaving their homeland, family and children behind, our enemies were teasing them. O Allah! Shower Your mercy on those faces whose color changed during the journey due to the hot sun. Shower mercy on those cheeks, which rubbed against the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.). Shower mercy on those eyes, which are crying on us. Shower mercy on those hearts, which are sad due to our calamities. Shower mercy on those loud wails, which came out upon hearing our troubles. O Allah! I hand over their bodies and souls to You so that You satisfy them at the cistern of Kauthar when people would be thirsty."" Imam (a.s.) prayed this again and again while prostrating. When he concluded his supplications and stood up from the prayer-mat, the narrator said, ""If the supplication, which you were saying now is said for a person who does not even recognize Allah then too I doubt if the fire of Hell would touch him."" The narrator swears by Allah that he should also have done the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) and he shouldn't have gone for Hajj. Imam (a.s.) said, ""You stay near the pure grave of Imam (a.s.). What stops you from doing his Ziyarat? O Muawiyah Ibne Wahab! Do not miss the Ziyarat of Imam (a.s.)."" Muawiyah said, ""May I be sacrificed on you, I never knew the excellence of the Ziyarat of Imam (a.s.) was such."" Imam said, ""O Muawiyah!

Then Allah ordered the sky to rain stones on those people and He ordered the earth to swallow them.""","Iqbal al-A`amal, page 332/333"
Akhlaq,133,Imam Muhammad ibn Ali [a],8,"Imam Muhammad Baqir relates that The community of Prophet Lut (a.s.) was one of the best creations. The accursed Shaitaan misguided them greatly. People used to go out for work leaving their women behind. Shaitaan used to damage their houses and belongings in their absence. They used to return home to find it messed up. All of them decided to catch the culprit red-handed. One day they hid in one place and kept a close watch on their houses. They saw a young and handsome boy come and damage their belongings. People caught hold of him and asked, ""Was it you who damaged our things earlier?"" ""Yes,"" replied the boy wickedly. People decided to execute that boy and gave the responsibility of holding him captive at night to a man. At night, the boy began to wail. The man asked, ""Why are you crying?"" The boy said, ""My father used to make me sleep on his chest."" The man said, ""You sleep on my chest."" The boy laid on his chest and began to rub himself with that man. The man also began doing the same to Shaitaan. Then Shaitaan disappeared suddenly. The man narrated the whole incident to his fellowmen in the morning. They were surprised and never knew about this act earlier. Then the people also started doing this act. They committed this act with each other at first and, began to do it with whoever passed by their city to an extent that people stopped passing through their town. They avoided their women and began to keep handsome boys to satisfy their sexual desires. When Shaitaan saw that all men have been misguided, he went to the women in the form of a lady. He told them that their men have sexual relations with other men. The women replied that he was right and they knew it and Prophet Lut (a.s.) had also advised them to keep away from this act. Now Shaitaan taught this act to women also and they began involve themselves with each other. When the argument of Allah was exhausted, He sent Jibraeel, Mikaeel and Israfeel in the form of boys wearing cloaks to that community. When they reached the city, they saw Prophet Lut (a.s.) working on his farm. The Prophet asked them, ""I have never seen anyone more handsome than you. Where are you going?"" They replied, ""Our Master has sent us to meet the elderly of this city."" Lut (a.s.) said, ""Doesn't your Master know what the people here do? By Allah, they catch hold of men and sodomize them till they bleed."" They said, ""Our Master has ordered us to pass through this city."" Prophet said, ""I have a request for you."" They asked what it was. Lut (a.s.) said, ""You wait here till nightfall."" Those boys sat there. Lut (a.s.) sent his daughter to bring some water and bread for them and blankets to save them from the cold weather. When the girl started walking towards her house, it began to rain heavily and the whole city was flooded. Lut (a.s.) said, ""The people of the city must have gone home. We can go now."" Prophet Lut (a.s.) was walking at the side while Jibraeel, Mikaeel and Israfeel were walking in the middle of the road. Lut (a.s.) asked them, ""O boys! Why are you walking in the middle of the road?"" They replied, ""Our Master has told us to walk on the middle of the road."" Prophet Lut (a.s.) comforted himself by thinking that it was night and there was minimum danger. The accursed Shaitaan threw a woman's child in the well and began to scream in the whole city. All the people gathered near the house of Prophet Lut (a.s.). They saw three handsome boys in his house and said to him, ""O Lut! You have also started doing this act."" Lut (a.s.) told them, ""These are my guests. Now do not embarrass me."" The people told him, ""You keep one of those handsome boys and hand over the other two to us."" Lut (a.s.) took them to a room in his house and closed the door saying, ""I wish I had a strong power to fight these people and defend you."" The people banged at his door and broke it open. They entered his house and attacked him. Prophet Lut (a.s.) fell on the ground. Jibraeel told Prophet Lut (a.s.), ""We are angels of your Lord. These people will not be able to hurt you a bit."" He picked up a handful of mud and threw on the crowd and said, ""Distort their faces."" All the people became blind as a result. Lut (a.s.) asked, ""O angels! What has the Lord ordered about these people?"" They said, ""The Lord has said that they will be chastised at dawn."" Lut (a.s.) said, ""I have a request."" He was asked what the request was. Prophet said, ""They should be punished just now."" They replied, ""The time of chastisement is at dawn. Isn't dawn near? You migrate from this city before dawn and take your daughter along leaving your wife behind."" Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) said that may Allah have mercy on Prophet Lut (a.s.) for his words, ""I wish I had a strong power to fight these people off"". He was not aware about the persons present in his house at that time. Can there be a support better than Jibraeel?"" The Almighty Allah told Prophet Muhammad Mustafa (s.a.w.s.), ""This chastisement is not away from the unjust in your Ummah i.e. if the people of your Ummah commit the sin similar to that of the people of Lut, they too will face similar chastisement.""","Iqbal al-A`amal, page 333/334/335/336"

One who offers Salaat in one-tenth part of night seeking reward from Allah, the Almighty Allah says to His angels, 'Note down the good deeds for this servant of Mine equal to the number of all the grains, leaves, trees and meadows'. One who offers Salaat for one-ninth part of night Allah grants him ten recommended supplications and hands over his scroll of deeds on the Day of Judgment in his right hand. One who offers Salaat for one-eighth part of night Almighty Allah grants him the reward of a martyr who was patient and had pure intention and Almighty Allah would also accept his intercession. One who offers Salaat for one-seventh part of night he would come out of his grave in such a state that his face would be shinning like a full moon and he would pass on the Sirat Bridge along with the protected ones of Allah. One who offers Salaat for one-sixth part of night would be counted among those who repent and his sins committed in past and future would be forgiven. One who spends one-fifth part of night offering Salaat would get a place in Maqbara-e-Ibrahim (a.s.). One who offers Salaat for one-fourth part of night would be considered first among the successful people for he would pass through the Sirat Bridge like a strong wind and enter Paradise without accounting of his deeds. One who offers Salaat for one-third part of night every angel whom he will meet will say to him, 'I wish even my position would have been so near to Allah like yours'. That person would be given the choice of entering Paradise through any of the eight doors. One who offers Salaat for half part of night giving him whole earth filled with gold seventy thousand times would not be sufficient as his reward. The reward of this deed is more than that of freeing seventy slaves from the progeny of Ismail (a.s.). One who prays for two-third part of a night would be given rewards equal to the number of grains of sand on earth and the weight of smallest deed would be equal to that of Mt. Ohad. One who involves himself in Salaat, Ruku and recitation of the Holy Quran he would be given a great reward. The smallest reward given to him is that he would be cleansed of his sins as he was on the day he was born. He would be given rewards and positions equal to the number of all creatures of Allah. His grave would remain illuminated forever. Sins and jealousy would be removed from his heart. He would be given salvation from the chastisement of grave. He would be given freedom from Hell. All those who were in his protection would be resurrected along with him. The Almighty Allah will say to the angels, 'O My angels! See this servant of Mine. He used to remain awake at night for the sake of My pleasure. Give him peace in Paradise. There are a hundred thousand cities in Paradise for him and all of them have all the things required to satisfy the desires of the eyes and the hunger of one's heart.

One who fasts for eight days all eight doors of Paradise would be opened for him. One who fasts for fifteen days would have his problems solved. One who fasts for more than this Allah, the Mighty and Sublime would grant him a greater reward.","Sawab al-A`amal, Page 84/85"

Akhlaq,299,Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa [s],2,"""Rajab is a glorious month. Allah doubles good deeds and wipes the sins in this month. One who observes one fast in Rajab, Hell would go away from him to a distance of a year and Paradise would be made obligatory on one who fasts for three days.""","Sawab al-A`amal, Page 85"
Akhlaq,299,Imam Ali ibn Musa [a],11,"""Know that Rajab is a great month of Allah. It is called Asam because there is no month so dear and excellent for Allah except this. It was respected even during the time of ignorance. When Islam arrived, it too increased the greatness and excellence of this month. Know that Rajab is the month of Allah, Shaban is my month and Ramadan is the month of my Ummah. Know that if a faithful person fasts seeking reward from Allah he has gained lots of pleasure of Allah. The fast of that person would end the anger of Allah upon him; a door of Hell would be closed for him. The reward of this fast with pure intention is better than giving an earth filled with gold as charity. No object in this world can make his reward complete except good deeds. As soon as night falls, Allah would fulfill his ten wishes. If he prays for worldly life his prayers would be accepted. One who prays for His friends, lovers and chosen people, Allah would accept his prayers. One who observes two fasts in the month of Rajab nothing in the earth and heavens can imagine the greatness of that person. He would get the reward of a truthful person who has never lied in his whole life-time. He would appear on the Day of Judgment in the similar state. That person would do intercession of others along with other truthful people till they all enter Paradise and settle down with those truthful persons. One who fasts for three days in Rajab, Allah would erect a barrier between him and Hell whose distance would be equal to travel of seventy years. Allah would say at the time of Iftar, 'You have right upon Me and My love for you has become obligatory. O angels! I hold you witness that I have forgiven his sins from start till the end'. One who fasts for four days in the month of Rajab, he will remain safe from calamities like the evils of Jinns, leprosy, leucoderma, mischief of Dajjal and the punishment of grave. He would get the reward of wise persons who repent. He would be handed over the scroll of deeds in his right hand and made to stand in the first row of worshippers. One who fasts for five days in the month of Rajab it is the duty of Allah to please him on the Day of Judgment. His face would be shinning like the full moon when he is resurrected on the Day of Judgment. Rewards equal to the number of grains of sand would be written for him and he would be made to enter Paradise without any accounting. He would be given choice to ask whatever he wants from Allah. One who fasts for six days in the month of Rajab, his face would be brighter than sun when he is resurrected on the Day of Judgment. Apart from this, he would be given extra light, which would light up all those gathered on that day. He would be gathered along with protected people and would pass through the Sirat Bridge without any accounting. His sins as great as disobeying parents and breaking relations will be forgiven. One who fasts for seven days in the month of Rajab, Allah would close all seven doors of Hell for him and prohibit the fire of Hell for his body. One who fasts for eight days in the month of Rajab, Allah would open all eight doors of Paradise for him one by one and he would be given choice to enter Paradise from whichever door he wishes. One who fasts for nine days in Rajab would come out of his grave saying Laa ilaaha illallaah and would not see anything except Paradise. The light of his face would brighten the people gathered on that day and people would think of him as a prophet. The minimum reward given to him at that time is entrance to Paradise without any accounts. One who fasts for ten days in Rajab would be given two emerald wings decorated by illuminating pearls and rubies. He would enter Paradise flying over the Sirat Bridge with the help of these wings. He would be counted among the just and dear ones of Allah. He is like one who prayed for a hundred years with the pure intention of seeking reward from Allah. One who fasts for eleven days in Rajab, there would be no one greater in front of Allah than him except one who has fasted more than him. One who fasts for twelve days in Rajab would be made to wear two dresses of brocade and silk. If one of those dresses is brought to this world it would illuminate the world from east to west and scent the world with fragrance better than musk. One who observes thirteen fasts in Rajab, a table would be spread under the shade of the Divine throne and a number of eatables would be laid on it for him. The span of this table would be seventy times the area of this earth. Trays made of brocade and rubies will be laid on it. Every tray would have seventy thousand types of eatables each having distinct aroma and color. That person would have food from this table while others would be involved in a great difficulty. One who fasts for fourteen days in Rajab, Allah would grant him huge palaces made of pearls and rubies of such kind that eyes have neither seen nor ears heard about nor can a human mind imagine them. One who fasts for fifteen days in Rajab would stand at the place of faithful people. Every angel, messenger and apostle passing by him would say, 'Congratulations, for you are in peace, near to Allah, honest, fortunate and happy and would rest in gardens'. One who fasts for sixteen days in Rajab would be among those who are first to ride upon the vehicles of bright light. He would fly from Paradise to the door of Mercy in these vehicles. One who observes seventeen fasts in Rajab, seventy thousand lamps would be illuminated for him at the Sirat Bridge so that he enters Paradise passing the bridge in the light of these lamps. Angels would welcome him saying, 'Well done' and 'Peace be upon you'. One who fasts for eighteen days in Rajab would be given a place on the thrones made of pearls and rubies in the Minaret of Ibrahim in Paradise. One who fasts for nineteen days in the month of Rajab, Almighty Allah would construct a palace of pearls for him facing the palaces of Adam (a.s.) and Ibrahim (a.s.). He would salute them and they too would salute him and respect his position. He would be given the reward of a thousand fasts for each fast. One who observes fast for twenty days in Rajab it is as if he has worshipped Allah for a thousand years. One who fasts for twenty-one days in Rajab, on the Day of Judgment he would get to intercede for people numbering the sinners of Rabi and Mudhir tribes. One who fasts for twenty-two days in Rajab a caller would give call from heaven, 'O friend of Allah! There are glad-tidings for you. There is great honor for you in Allah's eyes. You are friend of prophets, truthful ones, martyrs and the virtuous upon whom Allah has revealed His bounties and mercy. They are your best friends'. One who fasts for twenty-three days in Rajab a call would be given from heaven, 'O slave of Allah! You are fortunate. You have taken less pain and you are getting much more benefit. The veil is taken off from you. You are rewarded greatly by your Lord. You will be a neighbor of Khaleel (Prophet Ibrahim) in Darus Salaam. One who observes fast for twenty-four days in Rajab the Angel of death would come to him in the form of a handsome youth wearing a green brocade dress mounted on a green horse of Paradise. He would be holding a golden cup decorated with a green silk more fragrant than musk filled with the pure wine of Paradise. He would make that person drink that wine while taking his soul away. The difficulties at death-bed would be eased for him and his soul would be wrapped in green silk. Such a sweet fragrance would come out if it that all the inhabitants of seven heavens would be scented with it. He would remain satisfied in his grave as well as when he would be resurrected until he reaches the cistern of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). One who fasts for twenty-five days in Rajab would be surrounded by seventy thousand angels, each holding an umbrella made of pearls and rubies when he is resurrected from the grave. They would have ornaments and excellent dresses. They would say, 'O dear one of Allah! Let us go to Him soon'. Then he would go to Paradise first along with the dear ones of Allah. Indeed it is a great success. One who fasts for twenty-six days in Rajab the Almighty Allah would build a hundred palaces of pearls and rubies under the shade of His throne. There would be a tent made of red silk of Paradise in front of each palace. While people would be busy in accounting of their deeds, this person would rest over here peacefully. One who observes fast for twenty-seven days in Rajab, the Almighty Allah will expand his grave to the distance covered in four hundred years and the whole area would be fragranced with Amber and Musk. One who fasts for twenty-eight days in Rajab Allah would create a distance of nine barriers between him and the fire of Hell. The width of each barrier is equal to the distance covered in five hundred years between the earth and heaven. For a person who fasts for twenty-nine days in Rajab Allah would forgive him even if he would have robbed every man on the order of an unjust or even if she is a woman who has been unchaste seventy times. One who fasts for thirty days in the month of Rajab a caller would call out, 'O slave of Allah! Your past sins are forgiven. Your deeds can have a new beginning'. Allah would grant him all the gardens and every garden would have forty thousand cities. Every city would have forty palaces and every palace would have forty thousand houses and every house will have forty thousand dining tables and every dining table would have forty thousand dishes and every dish would have forty thousand types of cuisines each having a distinct color and aroma. Every house will have forty thousand golden thrones and the span of those thrones would be equal to two thousand hands. A virgin Hoorul Ein would be seated on each throne having three hundred thousand dazzling hair on their heads and each lock of hair would be held by one thousand slave-girls who will be scenting it with musk and amber so that the person who fasted during Rajab comes near her. All this is for the person who fasted for the whole month of Rajab.  Someone asked, ""O Messenger of Allah! What should a person do who is not able to observe fast for the whole month due to weakness, menstruation or some other reason?  The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, ""They should give food to poor as charity. I swear by Him in Whose control is my life that they would get much more than what I have said if they give charity daily. All the creatures of this earth and the heavens cannot even estimate one-tenth of the reward, which that person would get in Paradise.  Someone asked, ""O Messenger of Allah! What should a person do who is not able to pay charity also?  The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, ""He should recite the following Tasbeeh of Allah a hundred times daily for thirty days in the month of Rajab: 'Sub-h'aanal ilaahil jaleeli sub-h'aana mallaa yambaghit tasbeeh'u illaa lahu sub-h'aanal a-a'zzil akrami sub-h'aana mallabisal i'zza wahuwa lahu ahl'.","Sawab al-A`amal, Page 85/86/87/88/89/90/91"

Akhlaq,167,Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad [a],9,"""A virtuous person will be made to sit inside a grave and told that he will be punished with a hundred lashes.

He will be told that a single lash is the minimum possible. That person will ask the reason for the punishment. He would be told that one day he offered Salaat without Wuzu and passed by a poor man without helping him. The person will be given punishment of one lash and because of which his grave will become full of fire.""","Iqbal al-A`amal, page 284"

Imam (a.s.) replied, ""These two persons went to a tribe, which was celebrating a feast on that day. That tribe had an idol and none was allowed to go near it without offering a sacrifice. However there was no restriction on the size of sacrifice. The tribe refused to permit them passage unless they offered a sacrifice. One of those two persons said that he didn't have anything to sacrifice. Then he caught a fly, killed it and offered it as a sacrifice while other companion refused to sacrifice even a fly for the sake of anyone except Allah.

It is the month of Ramadan and Allah has made fasts obligatory for you in this month. A night of this month, in which one worships Allah offering recommended prayers, has a better reward than doing so for seventy nights in other months. Doing recommended acts in this month is equivalent to the reward of obligatory deeds of other months. Performing an obligatory deed in this month has reward equal to performing seventy such acts in other months. It is the month of patience and reward of patience is Paradise. This is the month of helping others. One who helps a believer in his Iftar, the Almighty Allah would grant him the reward of freeing a slave and his past sins would be forgiven."" People said, ""O Messenger of Allah! We all are not capable of offering Iftar to others."" The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, ""Allah is Merciful and He grant this reward to that person also who gives a little milk or a glass of drink or a few dates to others for Iftar. A person who is kind to slaves in this month, the Almighty Allah would be kind to him in accounting of his deeds. This is a month whose beginning is with mercy, middle is forgiveness and the end is with acceptance of supplications and freedom from Hell. There are four characteristics, which you cannot avoid. With two of them, you can please Allah and you cannot neglect the other two also. They are bearing witness that there is no lord except Allah and that I am His Messenger.

I swear by Him Who has appointed you as a true prophet, the status of that person near Allah is such that the deeds performed by him and others in the month of Ramadan would be accepted. Also Salaat and fasts of the people living between east and west that have faith in Oneness of Allah would be accepted. If this person repents his Salaat, fasts and Qiyam would be accepted. He would be forgiven and his supplications will be accepted because the Almighty Allah says in His book, 'And you that ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him.'

Akhlaq,50,Imam Jafar ibn Muhammad [a],9,"It is narrated from Mualla bin Khunais that one night Imam Ja'far Sadiq (a.s.) came out of his house. It was raining heavily. Imam walked and Mualla followed him. Suddenly a thing fell from Imam's hands. Imam recited Bismillaah and prayed to Allah to get the lost thing back. He went near the Imam and saluted him. Imam (a.s.) asked, ""Are you Mualla?"" He replied, ""Yes, may I be sacrificed for you."" The Imam said, ""Move your hand on the ground and see if you find something."" He started searching and came to know that it was a bag containing bread when he found it out. He told the Imam, ""May I be sacrificed for you, I will carry it."" Imam (a.s.) replied, ""I have right to carry it more than you but you come along with me."" They both went to the hutments of Bani Saidah. Some people were sleeping over there. Imam kept a few loaves near each person and they returned. Mualla asked Imam, ""Are they on the right religion?"" Imam (a.s.) replied, ""If they had been on the right religion I would have brought salt along with the bread. There is no creation of Allah which is deprived of necessities. Sadaqah is in the hands of Allah only."" Imam (a.s.) further said, ""Whenever my father used to give Sadaqah, he used to take it back from the hands of the beggar, kiss that Sadaqah and smell it and then return it to him. He used to do it so because Sadaqah goes into the hands of Allah before going into the hands of beggar. He used to say that I like to have in my hands too what Allah's hands had held. Giving Sadaqah in darkness reduces the anger of Allah and wipes greater sins. It makes accounting of deeds easier. Sadaqah given during day causes abundance in wealth and life. Once Isa Ibne Maryam passed by a sea. He dropped his food in the sea. One of his companions asked, ""O Ruhullah! Why did you do so? It was your food, why did you drop it?"" He replied, ""I dropped it so that the marine creatures consume it. It carries a great reward in front of Allah.""","Sawab al-A`amal, Page 189/190"

One who dresses someone else, the former will remain in Allah's protection till that person is wearing the dress and even if a single thread is remaining.

If a believer congratulates another believer, the Almighty Allah writes success for him till the Day of Judgment. If a believer shakes hands with another believer the Almighty Allah reveals one hundred blessings between their fingers, out of which ninety-nine are for one who loves his friends more. The Almighty Allah pays attention to him because of his love. When believers embrace each other, they are immersed in the Mercy of Allah and when they stand near each other for the sake of Allah, they are told, 'Allah has forgiven you. Your deeds will have a new beginning'. When they inquire about each other, angels tell each other, 'Keep away from them for they have their own secrets, which even Allah has kept hidden'.""

He says: The son of the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) sighed and he cried so much that his beard got wet with tears. He said, ""O Ishaq! The Almighty Allah orders the angels to stay away from believers while they are conversing so that they do not note down the conversation nor do they know about it. Their conversation is known to only Allah, the Guardian of secrets. O Ishaq! Fear Allah as if you are seeing Him because even if you cannot see Him, He is definitely looking at you.

Akhlaq,198,Imam Husayn ibn Ali [a],6,"Imam ?usayn ibn 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (a.s.) was asked about jihad, as to whether it was a recommended act or an obligatory one, to which he replied, 'Jihad comes in four forms, two of which are obligatory, one of which is recommended but can only be undertaken with an obligation, and one which is recommended. The first obligatory jihad is that which a man wages against his own self in keeping away from acts of disobedience to Allah. This is one of the greatest forms of jihad. Waging jihad against those disbelievers who persecute you is also an obligation. As for the jihad which is recommended but can only be undertaken with an obligation is to fight the enemy, which is an obligation upon the whole community, and which if they abandon, they are all punishable for it. It is a recommendation upon an Imam, the limit of which is to come and face the enemy and fight them with his community. As for the jihad which is recommended, it is [embodied in] every recommended practice which a person performs and strives in its performance, its completion and its revival. Such an act, and the striving to perform it is one of the best deeds because it is a revival of the Prophetic practice, and the Prophet (SAWA) has said, 'Whoever establishes a good habitual practice, he will get his own reward for it as well as the reward of whoever performs it after him until the Day of Resurrection, without any decrease in their reward thereof.'","Tuhaf al-`Uqoul, no. 243; Mizan ul Hikmah, page No. 378"
