1,Ziarat e Ashura,"Highly Recommended for solutions to all major problems, if recited  continiously for 40 days

Salih Bin Aqabah and Sayf ibn Umayrah have reported `Alqamah ibn Muhammad al-Hadrami as saying that he, once, asked Imam al-Baqir, Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him, to teach him a prayer with which he would pray Almighty Allah on that day (of Ashura) when he would visit Imam al-Husayn’s tomb and to teach him another prayer with which he would pray Almighty Allah on that day when he would be unable to visit the tomb and then he would point to the tomb and send greetings to Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) from his own house.

The Imam said, “Listen, Alqamah! After you point to Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) with greetings and offer the two-unit prayer, you may say the Takbir statement (i.e. allahu-akbar) and then say... (the forthcoming form of Ziyarah). If you do so, you will have said the prayer that is said by the angels who visit Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him). You will be also raised one hundred million ranks to join the rank of those who were martyred with him (i.e. Imam al-Husayn) and you will be included with their group. You will, moreover, be awarded the reward of the visiting of all Prophets and Messengers as well as the reward of all the visitors of Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) since the day of his martyrdom.”","Peace be on you, O Abu Abdullah! 
Peace be on you, O son of the Apostle of Allah! 
Peace be on you, O son of the commander of the faithfuls, the forebear of the successors! 
Peace be on you, O son of Fatimah, the choicest among the women of the worlds! 
Peace be on you, O the select, surpassing, chosen in preference over all good of Allah, and son of Allah's (such) good.
Peace be on you, who was martyred while fighting heroically in the cause of Allah, the son of Allah's fearless warrior, you were isolated and had been attacked with a vengeance! 
Peace be on you and on those souls who had gathered in your camp, and strided along with you, in your journey. I pray and invoke Allah to keep all of you tranquil and restful, for ever; so far I am alive, this is my prayer, and till nights and days follow each other. 
O Abu Abdullah! unbearable is the sorrow, nerve-racking is the agony, you put up with, for us and for all the (true) Muslims, crimes committed against you also shocked and unnerved the dwellers of the heavens, one and all. 
May Allah condemn and damn the people who laid the basis and set up the groundwork, to wander astray and turn aside from not only you and your family but to take liberties and bear hard upon you.
May Allah condemn and damn the people who tried to obscure and deny your office and status, willfully neglected your rank and class Allah had made know in clear terms. May Allah condemn and damn the people who killed you. 
May Allah condemn and damn the abettors who instigated and had a part in your murder. I turn to you and Allah, away from them, their henchmen, their followers and their friends, 
O Abu Abdullah, I pray and invoke Allah to send blessings on you. I make peace with those who make their peace with you, I make war on those who go to war against you, till the Day of Judgment. 
May Allah condemn and damn the family of Ziyaad and the family of Marwaan; 
May Allah condemn and damn the group and the tribe of Umayyah, one and all, altogether;
May Allah condemn and damn the son of Marjaanah;
May Allah condemn and damn Umar son of Saad;
May Allah condemn and damn Shimr; 
May Allah condemn and damn the people who bridled the horses and saddles for your martyrdom. I, my father and mother are at your disposal. Profound is my sorrow for you. I beg Allah, who honoured you above others, to be generous towards me on account of you, and give me the opportunity to be with the victorious Imam, the descendent of Mohammad (blessings and peace be on him and on his children from Allah) at the time of the final and decisive war against Allah's enemies.
O my Allah make me attend to Your cause, sincerely, in every respect following in Husayn's footsteps, in this world and the hereafter. O Abu Abdullah, I pray and invoke Allah to send blessings on you. I come nearer and seek greater intimacy with Allah, with His Apostle, with Ameerul Moomineen, with Fatimah, with Hasan and with you, with the help of your love and patronage, cutting off every connection with those who took up arms against you and killed you. 
I disconnect all links with those who, in the beginning, took the first steps to take liberties with and bear hard upon you, I take refuge with Allah and His Apostle (blessings of Allah be on him and on his children), free from the guilt of associating with those who laid the foundation for (your suffering), devised and carried out their corrupt plan of action, boldly gave currency to reign of terror and cruelty to oppress you and your friends and followers; 
I detach myself from them and present myself to Allah and to you, I (first) seek greater intimacy with Allah and then with you to win your love and patronage, and to make friends with your friends, cut off all links with your enemies, and with those who planted the seeds of hostility against you, and reject and discard their associates, their followers and their friends.
 I make peace with those who made their peace with you, I search out and confront those who waged war against you, I make friends with those who stood by you, I strive against those who came in conflict with you, therefore, I make a request to Allah to acquaint (me) with the awareness that perceives you and your friends, to set me free from the corrupting influence of your enemies, to make me keep company with you in this world and in the Hereafter, stand firm beside you and follow your footsteps closely in this world and in the next world. 
I beseech Him that he helps me to reach your highly praised station, given to you by Allah, (to meet you), that He provides me the opportunity to fight for justice and fairplay along with and under the leadership of the rightly guided guide (in your progeny) who surely will come and speak the truth. I beseech Allah in the name of your right and the purpose He assigned to you, that He overwhelms me with grief in memory of your sorrows, more than the personal grief that torments any one who is in great agony, sorrows which have no parallel and overshadow all calamities that took place in the history of Islam, for that matter, through out the whole universe.
O my Allah, in my on the spot situation, treat me like him (or her) who obtains from You (Your) blessings, mercy and forgiveness. 
O my Allah, bring me to life again, after death, in the place Mohammad and his ""Aal"" (children) are dwelling, and make me depart from this world like Mohammad and his ""Aal"" (children) had left,
O my Allah this day is a day of rejoicing for the ""Bani Umayyah"", the herd of hardened criminals, the eternally damned and accursed group, a fact that had been made public by You and by Your Prophet (blessings of Allah be on him and on his children), who, in every place and at all occasions, drew attention of people to this truism.
O my Allah condemn and damn Abu Sufyaan, Yazid son of Muwa'awiyah and let it be an everlasting curse upon tem from You. Today the descendants of Ziyaad and Marwan make merry, laugh and dance because on this day they killed Husayn (blessings of Allah be on him).
O my Allah, therefore, double up the curse You bring upon them and also the punishment You decree for them. 
O my Allah, I seek nearness to You today in this frame of mind, cutting off all links with them for the rest of my life, denouncing them because of my love for Your Prophet and his children, peace be on him and them.
 Then again say 100 times:
O my Allah condemn and damn the first tyrant who unjustly and wrongfully usurped that which rightly belonged to Mohammad and the children of Mohammad, and bring curse upon those who, after him, followed in his footsteps. 
O my Allah condemn and damn those conspirators who vexed and harassed Husayn, showed eagerness, agreed mutually, and joined hands to kill him. O my Allah bring curse upon all of them.
 (you may even recite only "" O my Allah bring curse upon all of them"". 100 times)
Then again say 100 times:
Peace be on you, O Abu Abdullah, and on those souls who came to your camp to put themselves at your disposal. 
So far I am alive and the days and nights follow each other I invoke Allah to send blessings on you for ever and ever. 
May Allah not make my this pledge of close association, physical as well as spiritual, with you the last fulfillment. 
Peace be on Husayn, and on Ali son of Husayn, and on the children of Husayn, and on the friends of Husayn. 
 You may even recite only "" Peace be on Husayn, and on Ali son of Husayn, and on the children of Husayn, and on the friends of Husayn."" 100 times)
Then say: 
O my Allah, let the curse I call down on the head of the first tyrant stick like a leech; and stay put for ever on the first, then the second, the third and the fourth. 
O my Allah damn and call down evil on the fifth, Yazid son of Mua'awyah, and bring a curse upon Ubaydullah son of Ziyaad, ibna Marjanah, Umar son of Saad, and Shimr, and on the descendants of Abu Sufyaan, on the descendants of Ziyaad, on the descendants of Marwaan, till the Day of judgement.
Then go in Sajdah(prostration) and say:
O my Allah! (All) praise is for You (alone); praise of the ""Ever-thankful to You"", who glorify You whatever come to pass. (All) praise is for Allah for my deep-felt intense grief. O my Allah make available for me the recommendations of Husayn on the day I present myself before You, let me stand firm in safety before You on account of my sincere attachment with Husayn, along with him and his comrades, who sacrificed everything they had (heart, mind, soul and life) for Husayn, peace be on him.",of Imam Hussain (as),زیارت عاشورہ,زیارت عاشورا,زيارة عاشُوراء,ज़ियारत ए अशुरा इमाम हुसैन (अ.स.),Ziarat e Ashura de l'Imam Hussain (as),ashura.mp3,,,1
2,Ziarat e Arbaeen,"Significance of Arba'een and the Performance of the Ziyarat of Arba'een
Imam Hasan Al-Askari (a.s.) includes the performance of Ziyarat-e-Arba’een as one of the five marks for a believer, in addition to reciting 51 raka of sala, audible recitation of Bismillah, wearing a ring on one’s right hand, and doing sajda on dust.  (This hadith has been narrated by Sheikh Tusi in the book Tahthib).
Why is so much importance given to the performance of the Ziyarat of Arba’een and the observance of Arba’een (40 days of mourning)?
Ziyarat, as we all know is a visitation, which in essence, is the act of speaking with and visiting our role models.  Of course the physical manifestation of the ziyarat is actually being present in Kerbala to perform the Ziyarat of Arba’een, but, in reality, that is not possible for every believer.  So does making ziyarat while not in Kerbala give one the same benefits?  Ahadith tell us that performing the Ziyarat of Imam Hussain (a.s.) far from Kerbala would hold the same significance as being in the land of Kerbala, as long as the person performing the Ziyarat has truly understood the status of the Imam and seeks to emulate him.
Imam Muhamed al-Baqir (a.s.) states that the heavens wept over Imam Hussain (a.s.) for forty mornings, rising red and setting red.  As we complete 40 days of remembrance of our Imam, we re-assert our pledge of obedience and loyalty to him, 
“I bear witness that you are the Imam (who is) the upright, the pious, well-pleased (with Allah), the pure, the guide and the rightly-guided.
I bear witness that you fulfilled the pledge of Allah and you struggled in His way…I am a friend of whoever befriends him ...”
By performing the Ziyarat of Arba’een, we pledge that we will continue to follow the path of justice and righteousness and will reject injustice and speak up against the oppressors of the time,
I am an enemy of whoever is his enemy 
In essence, we make a promise to continue to mold our lives according to the teaching of Imam Hussain (a.s.).  
But why is it that we mourn and remember Imam Hussain (a.s.) for a period of forty days and then move on?  
Our Prophet has said, “The earth mourns the death of a believer for forty mornings.”   Therefore it appears that the deceased should be remembered and mourned over for a period of forty days.  Performing an act for a continuous period of forty days is also known to help one to not just form a habit, but also to carry on the practice for the rest of his life.  
If we look at studies dealing with bringing a lifestyle change, we notice the time period emphasized to bring about a change is usually 6 weeks which is about the same time period as 40 days (to be exact it is 42 days).
In the book 40 Days to Personal Revolution: A Breakthrough Program to Radically Change Your Body and Awaken the Sacred Within Your Soul, the author Baron Baptiste explains the significance of forty days:
Why forty days? Because the number 40 holds tremendous spiritual significance in the realm of transformation. Jesus wandered in the desert for forty days in order to experience purification and come to a greater understanding of himself and his mission. Moses and his people traveled through the desert for forty years before arriving at their home in the holy land. Noah preserved the sacredness of life by sailing his ark for forty days and forty nights. According to the Kabbalah, the ancient Jewish mystical text, it takes forty days to ingrain any new way of being into our system….
Reciting particular duas for a period of 40 days is highly recommended in our practices as well.  
The unit 40 (forty) is said to be very effective. If a particular Duaa is recited 40 times, or 40 people gather to recite it, or it is recited for 40 days then its effectiveness is highly increased. (Duas.org)
It is reported from Imam Ja'fer Sadiq (a.s.) that whoever recites Dua-e-Ahad for forty days, after morning prayers will be amongst the helpers of the 12th Imam (a). Visitation of the shrine of Imam Hussain (a.s.) as well as Masjid-e-Sahla for 40 consecutive Thursdays is also very highly recommended and is one of the acts that promises a visit from the 12th Imam (ajtf).
Thus, as we perform the Ziyarat of Arba’een and commemorate the Arba’een, 40 days of mourning of Imam Hussain (a.s.), we hope and pray that this forty days of remembrance of Imam Hussain (a.s.), brings about a transformation in us by which we can continue to follow the path of Imam Hussain (a.s.) and carry on his message of upholding justice with true faith and a strong sense of sacrifice!

Peace be on Hussain, who gave his life in the way of Allah, a martyr, underwent untold hardships Peace be on the hostage surrounded by the-tightening circle of sorrow and grief, killed by a horde of savages. 
O my Allah I give witness that beyond a shadow of doubt he is Thy favorite and choicest confidant, who enjoys Thy confidence and favor, precisely like his father!
Thou looked upto him and elected him in Thy cause, picked and chose him for the good fortune, selected for him the best purified parents, appointed him guardian, leader, and defender of rights, a true representative (inheritor and progenitor) of guardians, leaders and defenders of rights, gave him much and more from the inheritance of the Prophets, put him forward as a decisive argument, along with the other successors (of the Holy Prophet-the twelve lmams) to the mankind. He met with deadly dangers, acted justly and fairly, made use of everything belonging to him to pay full attention to give sincere advice, took pains, made every effort and put his heart, mind, soul and life at the disposal of Thy mission to liberate the people from the yoke of ignorance and evil of bewilderment, but an evildoer, deceived with empty hopes of mean and worthless worldly gains, had pressed heavily on him, and sold out his share (eternal bliss) for the meanest and lowest bargain, betrayed his ""day of judgment"" for a vulgar return, took pride in insolence, fell into the fathom- well of silly stupid follies, provoked Thee and Thy Prophet to anger, did as the harsh discordant, the hypocrite, the heavily burdened bearers of sin, condemned to Hellfire, advised to him, however, he (the Holy lmam), steadily, rightly and justly coped With them, till, in Thy obedience, gave his life after which his family was set adrift.
O my Allah, therefore, condemn them to hell as a denunciation and conviction; and crack-down on them with a painful Punishment. Peace be on you O the son of the Messenger of Allah! Peace be on you O the son of the first of the successors (of the Holy Prophet)! I bear witness that Allah put faith in you like He had full confidence in your father, and that you always looked for and collected good and virtue, lived a highly praiseworthy life and departed from this world a martyr, forsaken and abused; I bear witness that Allah will promptly fulfill the promise, He made to you, and destroy those who left you helpless and punish those who killed you; I bear witness that you kept your promise made with Allah, and strived in His way till what was certain came upon you, so curse of Allah be an those who killed you, curse of Allah be on those who oppressed you, curse of Allah be on the people who came to know and approved. 
O my Allah be my witness that I make friends with those who love him and oppose those who deny him. I, my father and mother, are at your disposal 0 the son of the Messenger of Allah. I know and bear witness that you were ""light"" in the sublime loins and in the pure wombs, never touched you the dirt of ignorance, nor ever obscurity concealed you in its folds; I bear witness that you are the pillar of ""Deen"", support of the Muslims, refuge of the faithful; I bear witness that you are a truthful, well-aware, content, intelligent, rightly guided guide (Imam); I bear witness that the Imams among your descendants are the symbols of ""conscious piety"" and signs of ""true guidance"", the ""safe handle""-Islam, and the decisive arguments over mankind; I declare positively that I have full faith in you and I know for certain that you shall return. I am, fully committed to the laws of my religion, certain of my deeds, my mind and heart ready for your return, and my affairs carried out in the light of your instructions, till Allah gives you permission, together with you, along with you, not at the same time with your enemies.

Peace be on you, O the distinguished one of Allah and His sincere servant and the trustee of Allah and His chosen one and the Door of Allah and His Proof and the mine of the order of Allah and His secrets and the treasure of the knowledge of Allah and His safe-keeper and the representative of Allah in His creation. I bear witness that surely you established the prayer and gave the poor-rate and enjoined the good and forbade the evil and you obeyed the Apostle and you recited the Book as it ought to be recited and you conveyed (the message) from Allah's side and observed the covenant of Allah and through you, the words of Allah were completed, and you fought in the way of Allah as it ought to be and you advised for the sake of Allah and His Apostle, Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny and you offered sacrificed of your own self while you were patient and considerate, fighting in the defence of the religion of Allah, protecting, the Apostle of Allah, seeking what is near Allah, inclined towards what Allah has promised and you passed away in the religion you practised as a matryr and a witness and a witnessed one. Then may Allah grant you from the side of His Apostle and Islam and its adherents and the truthful ones, the best of recompense. I bear witness that among the people you were the formost in Islam and the most sincere in faith and most convinced in certitude and the most fearful of Allah and the most endurant of calamities and the most protective of the Apostle of Allah, Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny and the greatest in virtues and the most excessive in nobility and the highest in grade and most honoured in position and the most esteemed. You remained brave when everyone else became coward and you remained adhered to the course laid down by the Apostle of Allah, Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny and I bear witness that you were truly his caliph and there is absolutely no dispute in it despite the reluctance of the hypocrites and the wrath of the disbelievers and the grudge of the transgressors and you established the affair when people were slack and you spoke when they became dumb and you continued to walk along with the light of Allah when they had halted, the one who follows you has surely attained guidance. You were the foremost in speech, the most severe in encounters (with the enemy), the most correct in conversation and the most convinced in opinion and the bravest of hearts and the greatest in certitude and the best in action and the most cognizant of the affairs. You are a compassionate father of the believers. They were included in your family, then you shouldered their responsibilities which they could not cope up with, and you protected for them what they had wasted, and you guarded over what they had left behind, you were firm when they expressed fear and you showed determination when they were apprehensive, and you were patient when they were crying out for help. You were a severe retribution and a painful punishment for the unbelievers while for the believers you were a rain-shower, greenery and knowledge, your proof was not subdued and neither was your heart straitened and nor was your vision weakened nor was you afraid. You were like a mountain which even strong winds could not ruffle nor could thunder storm move it. You were as the Apostle of Allah said, Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny. 'Strong of body, humble of soul, esteemed near Allah, elevated in the earth and esteemed in the heavens. None could slander you nor could anyone hint (regarding any defect) at you, nor could any hopeful from the creation aspire for your position nor has anyone obliged you. You considered a weak and lowly person as powerful and honoured one till the time you take his right due to him and you considered a powerful and honoured one as a weak and lowly person till you snatch away the (usurped) right from him. The close and the distant were both equal in your eyes you are rightful, truthful and friendly in character. You saying is truth and prevalent. Your opinion is knowledge and resolutions. The religion became firm due to you and the difficult things became easy because of you and through you the fire has been extinguished and faith has been strengthened on account of you, and Islam is established due to you. Your calamity has wrecked humanity. Then to Allah we belong and unto Him shall we return. May Allah curse those who killed you and may Allah curse those who oppossed you and may Allah curse those who maligned you and may Allah curse those who oppressed you and usurped your right and may Allah curse those whom all these have been conveyed and yet they are agreeable to it. Surely we disassociate ourselves from them in front of Allah. May Allah curse the people who opposed you and denied your mastership and rose against you and fought with you and prevented people from associating with you and forsook you. All Praise be to Allah, the One who made Hell-fire as their abode and it is indeed a very evil place to enter. I bear witness for you, O the friend of Allah and the friend of His Apostle Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny concerning conveyance (of religion) and observance (of first) I bear witness that you are a loved one of Allah and His door and that you are a side of Allah and His Face though which He is approached and that You are the path of Allah and that you are the servant of Allah and the brother of His Apostle, Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny. I have come to you as a visitor due to your great status and position near Allah and His Apostle I seek proximity towards Allah though your visitation. I am desirous of your intercession. I seek my deliverance of through your intercession. I seek protection from Hell fire through you. I run away to you, fearful from my sins which I have burdened on my back. I come to you expectant of the Mercy of my Lord. I seek your intercession, O my master, before Allah and I seek proximity to Him through you so that He may grant me my needs because of you. Then intercede for me. O the leader of the faithful, before Allah, for surely I am a servant of Allah and your slave and your visitor and you have a famed position and a high status and a great position and an accepted intercession near Allah. O Allah, bless Mohammad and the progeny of Mohammad and bless Your servant and Your most loyal trustee and Your strongest rope and Your lofty hand and Your most beautiful words and Your proof over the mankind and your greatest testifier, the leader of the vicegerents and the pillar of the representatives and the support of the chosen ones. The leader of the faithful and the chief of the pious and the guide of the truthful and the leader of the righteous, the infallible protected from mistakes and abstained one from flaws and one free from defects and purified from doubts, the brother of Your Prophet and the vicegerent of Your Apostle, The one who slept on his bed, and defended him by his own soul and removed his difficulties, the one whom You have made as a word of his Prophet and a miracle for His Apostleship and a clear proof for his argument and the upholder of his flag and the defender of his life and a guide for his nation and a support for his fortitude and a crown upon his head and a door for his aid and a key for his victory to the extent that he vanquished the army of polytheism by Your support and destroyed the solders of disbelief by Your command and sacrificed his life for Your satisfaction and that of Your Apostle and made it an endourment upon obedience and a pivot for calamities to the extent that The Apostle, Blessings of Allah on him and his progeny, passed away in his hands and he annointed his face with the coldness of the Apostle's body and the angels assisted him in bathing the holy body of the Apostle and his burial, then he prayed over him and laid his body in the grave and discharged his debts and fullfiled his promise and adhered to his covenant and followed in his footstep and guarded his will and when he found helpless he rose up, independently, to carry on with the burden of caliphate and the leadership of the Nation. Then he set up flag of guidance among Your servants and spread the cloak of security in Your cities and he spread Justice among Your creatures and he Judged according to Your book among Your creation and he established the penal code and bridled disbelief and he resisted spite and he silenced mischief and eradicated feebleness and he put a end to breach and he fought against those who were disloyal, transgressors and the appositive and he always toed the path of the Apostle of Allah, Blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny and his manness and his grace and his beautiful conduct. He followed his traditions and remained attach to his determination and remained on his path and considered the character of the Apostle as a model before his eyes and admonished people towards it and called them to it till the your beard was dyed with the blood of your head O Allah, just as he did not give reference to skepticism over certainty in matter of Your obedience and did not associate any one with You even for the twinkling of an eye, bless him with a pure and ever-growing salutation so that, through it, he may attain the rank of prophethood in Your Paradise and convey to him, from us, greetings and salutation and grant us from Your side, concerning his mastership, grace and goodness and forgiveness and satisfaction. Surely You are the passion of abundant grace, Your mercy, O the most merciful of all those who show mercy.

obeyed in His Kingdom,
winner of the most praised qualities,
holder of the most praised honors,
honored by the Lord,
addressee (by Almighty Allah) from behind the (Divine) Veils,
most advanced in position,
and unovertakable.
I greet you with the greeting of him who acknowledges your right (that is incumbent upon us),
who confesses of his shortcoming in carrying out his duty towards you,
who does not discuss your limitless virtues,
who is sure that you will have more rewards from your Lord,
who believes in the Book that was revealed to you,
who deems lawful all that which you deemed lawful,
and who deems unlawful all that which you deemed unlawful.
O Messenger of Allah, I bear witness—and I join everyone who bears witness
and also bear witness rather than everyone who may deny it—
that you conveyed the messages of your Lord (flawlessly),
offered your nation good advice,
strove in the way of your Lord,
expounded openly what you were commanded to convey,
stood harm for the sake of Him,
called to the way of Him with excellent wisdom and fair exhortation,
fulfilled the duty with which you were commissioned,
you, verily, were compassionate to the believers,
strong against the unbelievers,
and you worshipped Allah sincerely until death came upon you.
Therefore, Almighty Allah has exalted you to the most honorable position of the ennobled ones,
to the most elevated place of the intimate servants of Him,
and to the most exalted ranks of the Messengers where none can come up with you,
none can excel you,
none can overtake you,
and none can even think of obtaining your rank.
All praise be to Allah Who saved us from perdition through you,
Who guided us off misdirection through you,
and Who lit our darkness through you.
O Messenger of Allah, may Allah reward you, for you are His envoy, with the best rewarding that He has ever conferred upon a prophet on behalf of his people
or a messenger on behalf of those to whom He has sent him.
May Allah accept my father and my mother as ransoms for you, O Messenger of Allah. I am visiting you for I acknowledge your right (that is incumbent upon us),
I confess of your superiority,
I know for sure about the straying off (from the right path) of those who dissent from you and from your Household,
and I admit the true guidance that you follow (and lead to).
May Allah accept my father, my mother, me, my family, my property, and my sons as ransoms for you!
Let me invoke Almighty Allah’s blessings upon you in the same way as Allah did send blessings upon you
and so did His angels, Prophets, and Messengers;
such blessings that are consecutive, abundant,
continuous, incessant, infinite, and unlimited.
May Allah send blessings upon you and upon your Household, the pure and immaculate, as much as you deserve.
O Allah, (please do) make You complete blessings,
Your perfect benedictions,
Your most virtuous boons,
and Your most honorable greetings, salutations,
dignities, and mercy,
as well as the blessings of Your archangels,
your commissioned Prophets,
Your elite Imams,
Your righteous servants,
the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth,
and (the blessings of) everyone who glorified You, O Lord of the worlds,
from the past and the coming generations—
make all these pour forth upon Mu¦ammad; Your servant, Your messenger,
Your witness, Your Prophet,
Your warner, Your trustee,
Your firmly established (in truth), Your confidante,
Your elite, Your most beloved,
Your friend, Your choice,
Your notable, Your elect,
Your well-chosen, Your mercy,
the best of Your created beings,
the Prophet of mercy,
the storer of forgiveness,
the leader to goodliness and blessing,
the savior of the servants (of Almighty Allah) from perdition by Your permission,
the caller of them to Your religion,
the custodian by Your order,
the first Prophet to make the covenant,
and the last Prophet to be sent (to humanity),
whom You have immersed in the ocean of virtue,
in the lofty rank,
in the elevated level,
and in the exalted position;
and whom You entrusted in the pure loins
and moved to the immaculate wombs
out of Your kindness to him
and Your compassion to him.
In order to safeguard, to shield,
to protect, and to defend him,
You assigned, out of Your omnipotence, a protective lookout over him
to keep him from the impurities of adultery
and from the defects of fornication;
thus, You raised the sights of the servants through him
and revived the derelict lands
when You removed the screening murk by the light of his birth
and dressed Your Holy Precinct the garments of brightness through him.
O Allah, as You have given him exclusively the honor of this noble rank
and the privilege of this great merit,
(please do) bless him for he fulfilled his covenant to You,
conveyed all Your messages,
fought against the infidels in order to prove Your Oneness,
exterminated the womb of atheism in order to strengthen Your religion,
and dressed himself the garb of misfortune in order to struggle against Your enemies.
Hence, You have given him as recompense for any harm that inflicted him,
any trickery that he faced
from the faction who tried to assassinate him;
a merit that excels all other merits
and due to which he possessed Your abundant gifts.
In return, he hid his sadness,
concealed his grief,
swallowed the pang,
and never did he violate the instructions of Your Revelation.
O Allah, (please do) send blessings upon him and his Household—blessings that You please for them,
and convey our abundant greetings and compliments to him,
and give us - from You on account of our loyalty to them - favors, kindness,
mercy, and forgiveness.
Verily, You are the Lord of great favor.
You may then offer a four unit prayer, each two alone, and recite any S£rah you want. At accomplishment, you may say the Tasb¢¦ al-Zahr¡' litany and then say the following:
O Allah, You have said to Your Prophet Mu¦ammad—
may Allah bless him and his Household:
“And had they, when they were unjust to themselves,
come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah
and the Messenger had (also) asked forgiveness for them,
they would have found Allah Oft-returning (to mercy), Merciful.”
I was not present at the age of Your Messenger—peace be upon him and his Household.
O Allah, I have visited him desiring, repenting from my ill deeds,
imploring forgiveness of my sins,
confessing of my having committed these sins although You know them more than I do,
and turning my face towards You in the name of Your Prophet, the Prophet of Mercy—
may Your blessings be upon him and his Household.
O Allah, in the name of Mu¦ammad and his Household, (please do) make me illustrious
in this world as well as the Next World and one of those brought near to You.
O Mu¦ammad!
O Messenger of Allah!
May Allah accept my father and mother as ransoms for you!
O Prophet of Allah!
O chief of all created beings of Allah!
In Your name do I turn my face towards Allah, my and your Lord,
so that He may forgive my sins,
accept my deeds,
and settle my requests.
Therefore, be my interceder before your and my Lord,
for my Lord, the Master, is the best besought
and You are the best interceder.
O Mu¦ammad!
May peace be upon you and upon your Household.
O Allah, (please do) confer upon me with forgiveness, mercy,
and sustenance that is outgoing, good, and beneficial from Your Presence
in the same way as You conferred upon him who came to Your Prophet, Mu¦ammad, when he was alive,
may your blessings be upon him and his Household,
and confessed of his sins.
Thus, Your Messenger prayed You to forgive him.
May your blessings be upon him and his Household.
And You did forgive him out of Your mercy, O most Merciful of all those who show mercy.
O Allah, I now put my hope in You, please You,
stand before You,
desire for You other than anyone else,
and hope for Your abundant reward
while I confess of my sins and I do not deny them,
I repent to You from whatever I have committed,
and I seek refuge with You from this position
against the deeds that I have committed
although You, firstly, had introduced them to me as prohibited, warned me against committing them,
and threatened me with Your punishment if I would violate.
And I seek shelter with the nobility of Your Face
lest You impose upon me the situation of disgrace and humility
on the day when the veils will be exposed,
the secrets and scandals will be disclosed,
and the muscles will writhe with fear;
on the day of regret and remorse,
the day of exposing the liars,
the day of the approaching doom,
the day of assembling,
the day of separation,
the day of punishment,
the day the measure of which is fifty thousand years,
the day of the blowing,
the day on which the quaking land shall quake
followed by oft-repeated commotions,
the day of raising the dead,
the day of exposition before the Fire,
the day when all mankind stand before the Lord of the Worlds,
the day when a man flees from his brother,
his mother, his father,
his wife, and his children,
the day when the earth and the sides of the heavens will split asunder,
the day when every soul will come pleading for itself,
the day when they will be relegated to Allah Who will inform them of what they did,
the day when a friend can in naught avail his friend
nor can they be helped
save him on whom Allah will have mercy.
Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful,
the day when they will be returned to the Knower of the invisible and the visible,
the day when they will be restored to Allah, their Lord, the Just,
the day when they come forth from the graves in haste,
as racing to a goal
and as locusts spreading abroad,
hastening toward the Summoner—
to Allah,
the day of the event inevitable
when  the earth will be shaken with a shock,
the day when the sky will become as molten copper
and the hills become as flakes of wool
and no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend,
the day of the witness and that whereunto he bears testimony,
and they day when the angels will come rank on rank.
O Allah, (please do) have mercy upon my situation on that day (when I will be stopped for interrogation) for my current situation,
and do not confound me at that situation for the wrongdoings that I have committed against myself.
O my Lord, (please do) group me, on that day, with Your intimate servants,
include me with the company of Mu¦ammad and his Household—peace be upon them—
make the Pond of him (i.e. the Holy Prophet) to be my arrival point,
make me a place among the honorable, white-forehead group,
and give me my Record (of deeds) in my right hand
so that I will succeed due to my rewards,
You will make my face white,
You will make easy for me my reckoning,
You will make my pan of the Scale (of deeds) outweigh,
and I will join the triumphant ones
among Your righteous servants
to Your Pleasure and gardens of Paradise.
O God of the Worlds!
O Allah, I do seek Your protection lest You may expose me on that day
in the presence of Your creatures because of my sins,
or I may encounter disgrace and regret due to my wrongdoings,
or You may make my evildoings outweigh my good deeds,
or You may declare my name as loser amongst Your creatures.
O All-generous, O All-generous,
(I beg You for) pardon, (I beg You for) pardon,
(I beg You for) covering (my evildoings), (I beg You for) covering (my evildoings).
O Allah, I also seek Your protection against including me, on that day,
with the line of the evils
or add me to the row of the wretched ones.
When You shall distinguish between Your creatures
and drive each group –according to their deeds-
to their final abodes in groups,
(please do) line me up, in the name of Your mercy, with the group of Your righteous servants,
and drive me with the group of the Your pious, intimate servants
to the gardens of Your Paradise, O Lord of the Worlds!
Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah.
Peace be upon you, O conveyor of good tidings (to the believers) and warner (against Allah’s chastisement).
Peace be upon you, O light-giving torch.
Peace be upon you, O intercessor between Allah and His creatures.
I bear witness, O Messenger of Allah, that You were light in the lofty loins
and purified wombs.
The ignorance could not stain you with its impurities
or dress you its gloomy garbs.
I also bear witness, O Messenger of Allah, that I have faith in you
and in the Imams from your Household,
and I believe in all that which you have brought,
satisfactorily and faithfully.
And I bear witness that the Imams from your Household are the signs of (true) guidance,
the Firmest Handle,
and the arguments against the inhabitants in this world.
O Allah, (please) do not make it the last of my pilgrimage to (the tomb of) Your Prophet—
peace be upon him and his Household.
If you decide to grasp my soul, I will bear witness in my death,
as same as I have born witness in my lifetime,
that Your are verily Allah; there is no god save You,
alone without having any associate,
that Mu¦ammad is Your servant and Messenger,
and that the Imams from his Household are Your intimate servants, Your supporters,
Your Arguments against Your creatures,
Your representatives amongst Your servants,
Your sings in Your lands,
the custodians of Your knowledge,
the keepers of Your secret,
and the interpreters of Your Revelation.
O Allah, (please do) send blessings upon Mu¦ammad and the Household of Mu¦ammad
and convey to the souls of Your Prophet, Mu¦ammad, and his Household,
at this very hour as well as all times,
greetings and compliments from me.

Strong and powerful support from the Truthful (Allah), was put at your disposal; (and) you had been kind and compassionate to the believers, (but) was harsh with the disbelievers, and had sincerely served Allah, till the inevitable (what was certain) came unto you.

O Allah, Thou said: “And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto you and asked forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the Messenger, they would have found Allah forgiving, Merciful.” O my Allah, therefore I turn repentant to Thy Prophet (S.A.), asking pardon for my sins, (so send blessing on Muhammad and on his children), and be kind to me.

25,Ziarat-e-Jamea Kabeer,"The second comprehensive form of ziyarah has been also reported by Shaykh al-¯ad£q in his two books of man-l¡-ya¦¤uruhul-faq¢h and `Uy£n Akhb¡r al-Ri¤¡ as follows:
M£s¡ ibn `Abdull¡h al-Nakha`¢ is reported to have asked Imam `Al¢ al-Naqi al-H¡d¢ (`a), saying, “O son of Allah’s Messenger! Please teach me a comprehensively eloquent saying that I may say whenever I visit any of you (i.e. the Holy Imams).” The Imam (`a) therefore instructed the following:When you arrive at the gate (of a holy shrine), after you have bathed yourself ceremonially, you may stop and utter the two professions of Islam (shah¡datayn)","I bear witness that there is no god save Allah Alone without having any associate And I bear witness that Muhammad—blessings of Allah be upon him—is His servant and Messenger When you enter and catch sight of the tomb, you should halt again and repeat saying Allahu Akbar—Allah is the Greatest—thirty times. Very serene and venerable, you should walk a few yards with slow steps and then halt anew and repeating saying Allahu Akbar thirty times. As you come within reach of the tomb, you should repeat saying Allahu Akbar forty times so that you would have said it one hundred times. After that, you should recite the following: Peace be on you O the family of the Prophet You are the seat of the Divine mission Unto you the Angels turn You are the destination of the Divine

Peace be upon you—who showed her love for alHusayn; the wronged, in many situations and had
to suffer awful heartbreaking misfortunes.
Peace be upon you—who guarded the Imam on
the Day of Ashura when he was killed, and
sacrificed her soul for the salvation of Zayn alAbidin at the gathering of the most wretched one
(i.e. Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad), and addressed a
speech, just like (Imam) Ali's, in the streets of Kufa
despite the presence of her enemies

Peace be upon you—who thrust her forehead with
the front part of the howdah, when she saw the
severed head of the Chief of Martyrs (i.e. Imam alHusayn), and caused blood to flow from beneath
her veil and from the howdah in the view of the
enemies.

oppressed.

home.
Peace be upon you who were wandered as
captive in cities.
Peace be upon you when you were bewildered in
that ruined place in Syria

Peace be upon you when you were bewildered as
you stood by the (severed) body of the Chief of
Martyrs and called at your grandfather; the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and his
family, saying, ""Oh, Muhammad! May the angels in
the Heavens bless you! This is Husayn under the
open sky! His turban and his clothes are stripped!
His limbs are severed! And your daughters are
taken captives! Complaining (about this) is only to
Allah.""
You also said, ""O Muhammad! This is Husayn!
Winds are blowing his body! His head is cutt off
from the back! He is being killed by bastards! Oh,
for my grief for you, Abu Abdullah!

Peace be upon you whose heart cried out for alHusayn; the oppressed, the stripped, and the
thrown on dust, and you said in a sad tone, ""May
my father be sacrificed for the one for whom I may
sacrifice my soul! Oh, for him who was depressed
until he passed away! Oh, for him who had been
thirsty until he departed life! Oh, for him whose
beard is dropping blood !""
Peace be upon her who wept for the (severed)
body of her brother among the killed ones so
painfully that every one—whether friend or even
enemy, wept for her and, moreover, people, as it is
proved by authenticated narrations, saw even
horses shed tears, which flew on their legs.  

Peace be upon her who took the responsibility of
gathering and guarding the daughters of the
Messenger of Allah and the children of al-Husayn
on the afternoon of the day of Ashura, and she
stirred up the situation when the two oppressed,
strange children were martyred.
Peace be upon her whose eyes did not sleep so
as to guard the family of the Messenger of Allah at
Taff of Nineveh, and was taken as captive as she
was humiliated at the hands of her enemies.

Peace be upon her who had to ride a saddleless
camel and then called on her brother Abu'l-Fadhl
(al-Abbas), saying, ""O brother! O Abu'l-Fadhl! It
was you who helped me ride on a camel when I
left Medina.""
Peace be upon her who addressed a remarkably
expressive speech at the center of Kufa that she
made all voices keep silent (to listen to her with
astonishment)
Peace be upon her who said clear-cut arguments
in the gathering of (Ubaydullah) Ibn Ziyad who said
to her, ""How did you see that which Allah had
done to your brother?"" Answering him, she said
with honest evidences, ""I saw nothing but good!""
 Peace be upon you who had to be imprisoned by
the enemies under an open sky, and had to see
people of Syria celebrate (the martyrdom of her
brother) with pleasure, joy, and raised flags
Peace be upon her who was tied with a rope on
the arm and the neck of Imam Zayn al-Abidin, and
she, along with sixteen persons from the family of
the Messenger of Allah, was forced to enter (the
session of Yazid) while they were enchained with
iron fetters. 

Meanwhile, Ali ibn al-Husayn (Imam Zayn alAbidin) said to Yazid, “What if the Messenger of
Allah sees us in such a manner? What will be his
impression?”
Then, Lady Zaynab; mother of misfortunes, said to
Yazid after he had poetized, ""(Had my forefather
whom were killed at the Battle of Badr witnessed
this,) they would have been very much delighted.
then they’d have said, “May your hands, O Yazid,
never be paralyzed
How dare you hit the lips of Abu ‘Abdullah (a), the
Master of the Youths of Paradise?""
She then said, ""Although calamities have forced
me to speak to you, I see you trivial in my eyes and find your verbal attacks great and I regard
your rebuke too much to bear, but the eyes are
tearful, and the chests are filled with depression.
What is even stranger is that the honored Party of
Allah is being killed by the Party of the ‘Released
ones’—Party of Shaitan.

If you regard us as your booty, you shall soon find
us as your opponents—that will be when you find
nothing but what your hands had committed, “And
your Lord never treats His servants
unjustly.(41:46)” To Allah is my complaint, and
upon Him do I rely.
So scheme whatever you wish to scheme, and
carry out your plots, and intensify your efforts, for,
by Allah, you shall never be able to obliterate our
mention, nor will you ever be able to kill the
revelation (that was revealed to us), nor will you
ever exalt to our position, nor will your shame ever
be washed away.
Your view shall be proven futile, your days limited
in number, and your wealth wasted on the Day
when the caller calls out, “The curse of Allah be
upon the oppressors.(11:18)” All praise is due to
Allah, Lord of the Worlds, Who sealed the life of
our early ones with happiness and forgiveness,
and that of our last ones with martyrdom and
mercy. We plead to Allah to complete His rewards
for them, grant them an increase, and recompense
us pleasingly; He is the most Merciful, the most
Compassionate. Allah suffices us, and He is the
best Guardian.
May Allah bless Muhammad and his Pure,
Immaculate Household ",,زیارت بی بی زینب سلام اللہ علیہا,زیارت حضرت زینب سلام اللہ علیہا,زيارة السيدة زينب (س),ह. बीबी ज़ैनब (स.अ.) की ज़ियारत,Ziarat de Bibi Zainab (s.a.),ziarat_zainab.mp3,,,33

38,Ziarat Al Nahiya,"Of the several prescribed Ziyarat of Imam al-Husain (PBUH), one was recited by Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) and reached us through one of his four special deputies. For that reason, it is known as the Ziyarat that was issued from the sacred side (Ziyarat al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa).[1] One of the most important features of this Ziyarat is that in different phrases, Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) graphically describes the events of Ashura and the agony that Imam al-Husain (PBUH) and his family faced on that horrific and ominous day.
The text of the Ziyarat al-Nahiya is found in some early Ziyarat collections such as al-Mazar al-Kabir, by Muhammad Ibn Ja’far al-Mash’hadi, pp. 496-513. It is also reported in al-Mazar, by al-Mufid as mentioned in Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 98, pp. 318-329.
An overview of the Ziyarat al-Nahiya
Since this Ziyarat (as reported in al-Mazar al-Kabir, by al-Mash’hadi) originated from an infallible Imam who is the tongue of Allah, it is replete with divine recognition, guidance, spirituality, knowledge of religion, lessons for humanity, and the historical facts.
The method of presentation in this Ziyarat follows the formal method seen in other texts by Ahl al-Bait (PBUT). The text of this Ziyarat can be divided into the following ten major parts:
1-       Offering peace and salutations to the Prophets (PBUT) (whose spiritual heir was Imam al-Husain (PBUH)), from the earliest ones up to Prophet Muhammad(PBUH&HF), and then his pure progeny (PBUT) in addition to describing some of their attributes. For instance, we recite: “Peace be upon Adam, the chosen one of Allah from among His creation ...”
2-       Offering peace and salutations to the Chief of Martyrs (PBUH) and enumerating some of his spiritual qualities and divine titles: “Peace be upon al-Husain who sacrificed himself up to the last drops of the blood of his heart. Peace be upon him, who obeyed Allah secretly and openly... Peace be upon the son of the Garden of refuge. Peace be upon the son of Zamzam and al-Safaa. Peace be upon him who was saturated in (his) blood ...”
3-       Sending salutations to the martyrs of Karbala, in general, who sacrificed their selves for the divine cause: “Peace be upon the bloodstained chests... Peace be upon the pallid bodies... Peace be upon the dismembered limbs. Peace be upon the heads raised upon lances ...”
4-       Stating the motivations, wishes, and aims for visiting Imam al-Husain (PBUH): “Peace be upon you! Indeed, I intended your visitation and am hopeful of achieving the prosperity that is with you. Salutations to you, salutations from he who recognizes your sanctity, is a sincere (believer) in your guardianship, seeks nearness to Allah through your love, and is aloof from your enemies ...”
5-       Bearing witness to the Imam’s exemplary way of conduct: “I bear witness that you certainly established prayer, gave alms, enjoined good, forbade evil and transgression, obeyed Allah, never disobeyed Him, held fast to Him and to His rope, pleased Him, and held Him in awe ...”
6-       Explaining the Imam’s method of opposing evil: “when tyranny became wide-spread, injustice removed its veil, wickedness called upon its followers... the knowledge demanded you for disavowal (of falsehood), and made it incumbent on you to struggle against the deviant. Therefore, you set out in company of your children, kinsfolk, followers, and supporters, disclosed the truth and clear proofs, summoned people towards Allah with wisdom and fine exhortation ...”
7-       Presenting some of the calamities and afflictions that befell the Imam, and describing his martyrdom and the capture of his family: “The enemy then surrounded you from all sides, weakened you by inflicting wounds, while you did not have any helper left, and you were bereaved yet patient ...”
8-       Enumerating the depth of the crime: “Certainly, by killing you, they have killed Islam, disrupted (the truth of) prayer and fasting, revoked the (prophetic) customs and the (divine) laws... Certainly, (by this event,) the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HF) was wronged, left alone, and denied vengeance, the Book of Allah, the mighty and the majestic, was again abandoned ...”
9-       Relating the mourning ceremonies of the Prophets, Angels, and the cosmos: “Indeed, the Messenger (PBUH&HF) became distressed and his depressed heart wept. The Angels and the Prophets offered their condolences to him for your martyrdom. Your mother, al-Zahra, became distressed and bereft of you. Legions of Angels came in waves to offer their condolences to your father, the Leader of the Faithful ...”
10-  Praying to Allah and imploring Him: “O Allah! By the sanctity of this exalted place (the tomb of Imam al-Husain (PBUH)), bestow blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, assemble me in their company, and admit me to Paradise by their intercession ...”
A blend of wisdom, cognizance, spirituality, ethics, elegy, enthusiasm, devotion, along with a detailed account of the events has made this divinely inspired Ziyarat, one of the most insightful Ziyarat of Imam al-Husain (PBUH) for the followers of Ahl al-Bait (PBUT).
In what follows, the Arabic text alongside its English translation and transliteration of the original Ziyarat al-Nahiya as reported in al-Mazar al-Kabir, by Muhammad Ibn al-Mash’hadi, is presented.
May Allah hasten the advent of Imam Mahdi (PBUH), the reviver of the religion of Allah, the avenger of the blood of the Chief of Martyrs (PBUH) from the oppressors, and the establisher of peace and justice over the globe.","Peace be upon Adam, the senior-most of Allah among His creation.

 And you raised the pillars of faith and dug up the foundations of corruption. And trampled the heads of the disobedient, and (you are) the sincere advisor of the Ummat (of the Prophet).
 And simmer in the whirlpool of death, and you are the one who is merciful towards Islam and the Muslims, and a supporter of truth and most patient in the calamities and the protector of faith, and one who deflects those who attack it. 
You protect guidance and help it. And propagate justice and equity and help the religion and make it manifested and hinder and obstruct those people who consider it lowly. And extract the rights of the weak from the strong .And with regard to the orders, both of them (the weak and the strong) were equal in your eyes.
 And you were spring-time for the orphans and a refuge for the creatures and honor of Islam and a mine of divine laws and possessed the capability of fulfilling the needs of
 the needful. You walked the path of your grandfather and your father, and like your brother (Hasan) you enjoined good.
 And you fulfilled your duties and responsibilities with utmost readiness. Well-known for your charity, you performed the mid-night prayer. Your path was firm, benevolent among the creatures, greatest for every excellence, respectable with regard to the lineage. Your perfection was at its peak and you had an exalted position for your several Excellencies. You were of a high status and had many meritorious qualities. Your manners were
 praise-worthy, your bestowals were valuable. You were magnanimous! Guide! And very benevolent; Knowledgeable, a martyred Imam and one who warned the people with regards to Allah's commands).
 You are the son of the Hay Prophet -Peace be upon him and his progeny and a support for the Holy Quran. And the arms of the Ummat (Muslims). And the one strived much in the way of Allah's obedience. Protector of the oath and promise. You remained away
 from the ways d the transgressors. A Giver to those in trouble. One who prolonged the rukoo and sajdah.
 Unattached to the world as if you have to leave it soon. You always viewed the world with dislike. Your wishes were not worldly. You were very far from its comforts and embellishments and aloof from it's pomp. And it is well-known that your attachment is only with the Hereafter. Till the time that corruption became audacious and the slight veil lifted from the face of injustice and it summoned its cahoots for support. Then at that time you were at the sanctuary of your grandfather (Medina) and absolutely aloof from the unjust people. You sat in the prayer niche, busy in the prayers. You were far from the worldly vices and desires. You protected your heart and the tongue from every evil
 and in proportion to your strength and ability you kept your self secure.
 Then through your truth-perceptive knowledge you refused (the allegiance to Yazid) and made it incumbent upon yourself to fight against the transgressors and the corrupt. Then you immediately set out in company of your sons, family-members, followers and friends. You called the people to ward's Allah with truth and by clear and open arguments. And by wisdom and good advice. Then you ordered the establishment of lawful limits and the obedience of Allah and restrained people from evil, prohibited sinful acts. But the atrocious people oppressed you with injustice and tyranny. 
So you warned them of divine retribution before you made Jehad with them. And you emphasized to them and presented a firm argument against them, but inspite of this they broke every oath and allegiance regarding you. And they angered your Lord and your
 grandfather and initiated the attack upon you. So you also became prepared with spear and sword for the battle and attack. And you routed the army of transgressors. And you were surrounded in the dust of the battle and fighting with Zulfiqar with so much ferocity
 as if Ali (a.s.) was himself fighting.
 So when the enemies saw you to be resolute and fearless they began to plot and lay traps for you and began to fight with you with the cunning and mischief. And the accursed Umar ibne Sa ad ordered his cunning army to cut off the water supply. And all of them unleashed their atrocities towards you.
 They did not take into consideration their duties with respect to you. They did not hesitate to slay you and your group of followers. How great was their sin of plundering your belongings. You were bearing the tribulations of the battle with so much patience that the angels of the sky were astonished.
 Then the enemies surrounded you from all the sides and began to give you one injury after another and made you fatigued. No helper remained between you and your women and children. You were still deflecting the crowd of attackers with persistence and patience away from your women and children.
 Till the tiri1e they forced you down from the horse-back. And you descended to the earth, wounded. The horses were trampling you with their hooves. The atrocious-army fell upon you with their swords.
 The perspiration of death appeared on your forehead and your hands and feet folded and unfolded to the right and the left.
 You were beholding your wounds and your children too, when in such a situation you might not have thought of your children and family due to the severe pain. At that time your horse galloped towards your camp, weeping and neighing.
 When your ladies saw your rider less horse and the saddle which had slipped downwards, they became rest-less and came out of the tents. Their hair awry, they slapped their own faces and wailed and lamented. They were calling their elders and ancestors in a dejected condition after having been so much respected. They all headed towards the place of your slaughter. What a pity !
 That at that time the accursed Shimr was astride your chest and was moving his sword upon your neck as he held your hair with his hand. And was slaughtering you in this way
 will his sword . You had become motionless and your breathing was about to stop. Till the time you were beheaded and your head was raised up on the sword. And your women were arrested like slaves and tied up with heavy iron chains and made to sit on the camels.
 Their faces were seared in the heat of the sun during the day. They were taken around in the desert and wilderness like homeless people. Their hands were tied to their necks. In this condition they were made to march in the markets.
 Woe be unto those disobedient transgressors who murdered Islam by killing you. And invalidated the prayers and fasts. And broke up the (Prophetic) practice and the
 (Islamic) laws. And demolished the regulations of faith. And burnt up the verses of the Quran and they rushed into transgression and rebellion. Certainly the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) became a victim of injustice, because of your death which he could not avenge. And the Book of Allah became heirless. And your harassment was actually the harassments of truth.
 And because you were not anymore, the calls of Allah-o-Akbar and La-ilaha-illallah lost their essence. No criteria remained for the distinguishing of the prohibited and the
 permitted acts. Neither the Ouran, its meaning and it's exegesis remained. And after you was the advent of open distortion in Shariat and the spread of false beliefs, and the ineffectiveness of Islamic Law. There was a surge in the selfish desires and deviations and there was an advent of corruption, transgression and evils.
 Thus the pleader came near the grave of your grand-father, the Prophet (Peace be upon him am his progeny) and pleaded with tears flowing from his eyes he said, '""0 Prophet of Allah! Alas! Your grandson, your children have been massacred. And Your family and your devotees have been harassed, and killed. Your progeny were taken as prisoners
 after your demise. And your modest descerK1an1s and dose relatives were put through untold hardships.
 Hence the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) became very aggrieved and his soft heart began to weep. The angels and the prophets offered condolences to him with regard to you. Your respected mother, Zahra (s.a.) was in agony because of your massacre. Armies after armies of angels arrived to offer their condolences to your respected father Amirul Momineen (a.s.). and the Maatam stated for you in the skies. Hoories of Paradise slapped their own faces in your grief. 
And the sky begun to weep and so did it's inhabitants and the chain of mountains began to cry. And the sea and the fishes wept. And Mecca and it's buildings and Paradise and it's young male servants and Kaaba and the Maqaam-e-Ibrahim and ""Hill"" and ""haram"" all began to sob.

39,Ziarat e Ameenullah,"This is the Ziarat of Imam Ali (a), recited when visiting his grave, or from afar when commemorating his death date, the day of Ghadir and other such occasions.
This Ziarat has been taught by the fourth Imam (a.s) who used to recite it at the grave of Imam Ali (a.s). It is a Dua, as well as a Ziarat. Hadith tells us that it carries great reward, and will be kept as a proof of the recitor's love for the Ahlul Bayt (a.s).","Peace be on you, O trusted guardian, appointed by Allah, to administer His earth, and to convince the mankind to accept His plan. Peace be on you, O Ameer ul Moomineen;  I testify that you made utmost efforts, as it should be, in the cause of Allah, acted upon His Book, followed the way of life of His Prophet, (blessings of Allah be on him and on his children ) ,  to the last moment of your life, until Allah invited you to come unto Him, and used His discretion to take you away,  and sealed your enemies' doom with the blame that the arguments had been made known to one and all through you.  O Allah let me be happy and satisfied with that which Thou considers good for me, let me agree with that which Thou decides for me, let me passionately remember Thee, and invoke Thee,  let me be in love with Thy pure and sincere friends, let me be well-liked and respected on the earth, and in the heavens, let me be unruffled and well composed in the midst of misfortunes,  let me be gratefully thankful in prosperity, let me be mindful of much and more bounties, let- me ardently desire for the heart warming meeting with Thee; well-equipped with piety to gain my end on the Day of Requital,  let me follow into the footsteps of Thy representatives, let me disassociate myself from the mannerism of Thy enemies, let me pass my time, in this world, by praising and glorifying Thee.  O Allah, verily, the hearts of those who surrender to Thee, are full of passionate love, the path of those, who long for Thee, is the straight (true) road,  the instructions given by those, who lean on Thee, are distinct and precise, the minds of those, who are aware of Thy reality, are filled with awe and reverence,  the call of those, who invite unto Thee, is loud and clear, and the doors of approval are kept open for them;whoso submits his supplication to Thee receives a favourable answer,  whoso turns repentant unto Thee gets acceptance (amnesty), whoso bursts into tears in fear of Thy punishment obtains mercy, whoso seeks redress from Thee finds the required assistance at his disposal,  whoso asks for Thy help procures the aid as a gift. Thy promise made with Thy servants is fulfilled;  whoso asks for pardon of his errors finds them reduced to nothing, whoso does everything for Thysake discovers that each and every deed has been preserved. The means of livelihood available to the created beings come from Thee like a rainfall,  and in addition many recurring favours and bounties reach them in regular successions, the sins of those, who ask for forgiveness, are overlooked,  the wants and needs of all that which has been created by Thee are properly satisfied, those who put forward genuine demands get more than they ask for, one after the other, again and again;  for the hungry wholesome food is arranged, for the thirsty clean water is available in abundance.  O Allah give favourable answer to my prayer, acknowledge the praise I sing in worship, let there be peace and harmony between me and my friends,  for the sake of Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn;  verily, Thou art my Benefactor who provides with bounties, the aim of my desires, the ultimate destination of my hopes, in my future life, and during this short life.  Thou art my God, my Master and my Lord;welcome my friends, keep our enemies away from us;to save us from the evil mischief divert their attention,  let the ""true Word"" come out in the open, supreme and dominant, refute and condemn the ""foullie"", rendered contemptible, verily, Thou art able to do all things.

Peace be upon you the family of the Prophet of Allah, Peace be upon you O people of secret conversations (with Allah), I bear witness that you proclaimed and advised and persevered for the sake of Allah and that you were belied and evil was done to you and you forgave and I bear witness that you are the rightly guided leaders and that obedience to you is incumbent and that your speech is correct and that you invited (to the truth) but were not answered and you commanded but were not followed. I bear witness that you are the pillars of religion and support of the earth, you were always under the (caring) eyes of Allah who was transferring you from the wombs of the pure ones, the era of ignorance did not contaminate you; the sedition of desires has not partaken of you, you have become pure; your origin is pure. Through you He has favoured us (with His religion). He has created you in houses in which Allah has allowed His name to be elevated and remembered. He has made our salutations to you to be mercy for us and expiation of our sins for Allah has chosen you for us and has made our creation pure because He has favoured us with your affection. We are named in front of Him due to your Gnosis and because we acknowledged and believed in you. This is the position of one that has been extravagant and has erred; He has submitted and acknowledged what he has committed and hoped of his sincere position and through you he will be saved from destruction so be my intercessors. I have come to you for the people of the world have turned away from you and have taken the signs of Allah as jest and have become arrogant. O One who is upright and does not over look; O Eternal One who does not disregard and covers all things You have favoured me with Your help and have shown me the path which You established for me; for Your slaves have turned away from it and have become ignorant of its knowledge and have belittled its rights and have inclined to others; it is Your favour on me with the people that be to You for I am in front of You in this position remembered and subject to (Your) decree so do not deprive me of what I hoped for and, by the sanctity of Muhammad and his pure family, do not disappoint me what I have asked from You, send Your blessings on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.",,زیارات ائمہ بقیع,زیارت ائمه بقیع(ع),زِيارَة اَئمَّة البَقيع (عَ),ज़ियारत ऑफ़ आम्मा (अ.स.) इन बाक़ी,Ziarat des Aemma (as) à Baqi,aaemabaqqi.mp3,,,27

The first form is the same as Ziyarah on the first of Rajab, and the second  as in the book of ‘al-Balad al-Amin’, Shaykh al-Kaf`amiy has reported Imam al-Sadiq (a.s) as saying that one may stop at the holy tomb of Imam al-Husayn (a.s) and say the following:","All praise be to Allah; the Most High, the All-great.
Peace be upon you; O the righteous, pure servant (of Allah).
I entrust with you a testimony of mine that takes me near you on the day of your intercession (for some people).
I bear witness that although you were slain, you have not died;
Rather the hearts of your adherents (Shi`ah) are living on the hope of your being alive;
And by the light of your illumination have those seeking you been guided (to the right path).
And I bear witness that you are verily the Light of Allah that has not and shall never be extinguished.

And you have never been defeated since Allah is the One Who is supporting you.

46,Ziarat Imam Ali (as),"This is the day on which Imam `Ali Amir al-Mu'minin (a.s) departed life as martyr. In the book of ‘Hadiyyat al-Za’ir’, it is  referred to the words said by al-Khadhir on this day. These words can be considered a form of Ziarat /visiting Imam `Ali (a.s) on this day.  These words, quoted from al-Kafi 1:454, are as follows:-","May Allah have mercy upon you, O Abu’l-hasan.
You were the first of all in accepting Islam and the most sincere of all in faith,
And you were the firmest in conviction and the most Allah-fearing,
And you were the most steadfast (against ordeals for the sake of Islam) and the most watchful for Allah’s Messenger—peace be upon him and his Household,
And you were the most careful for his companions and you were endowed with the most favorable merits,
And you were the foremost of everyone else in everything, and the owner of the most elevated rank,
And you were the closest of them to Allah’s Messenger—peace be upon him and his Household,
And you were the most similar to him in guidance, morals, manners, and deeds,
And you were the owner of the most honorable position, and the most respected (by Almighty Allah and His Messenger). 
May Allah reward you on behalf of Islam, the His Messenger, and the Muslims with the best rewarding.
You became stronger when his companions became weak,
And you advanced when they surrendered,
And you stood up (to face difficulties) when they became showed weak-heartedness,
And you abode by the course of Allah’s Messenger—peace be upon him and his Household—as they were his companions,
And you were truly his vicegerent.
No one could ever compete with you or vie with you in this position
In spite of the existence of hypocrites and the despise of the unbelievers,
And the malice of the enviers and the disgrace of the wicked ones.
You thus managed the matters when they failed to do so
And you spoke (the truth) when they stammered,
And you carried on with the light of Allah when they stopped.
As they followed you, they were guided (to the true path),
You voice was the lowest (out of politeness) and was the highest in supplication,
And you were the least in speaking and the you were the most eloquent of them,
And you were the most apposite in opinions and the most courageous,
And you were the firmest in conviction, the best of them in deeds, and the most learned in questions.
By Allah (I swear), you were the true leader of the religion first and last:
You were thus the first (of the enduring ones) when the other people departed, and you were the last (in steadfastness) when they failed.
For the believers, you were merciful father, as they were your dependants;
So, you carried the burdens that they were too weak to carry,
And you preserved that which they forfeited, and you conserved that which they neglected,
And you prepared yourself for facing those who allied (against Islam) and you advanced when they were dismayed,
And you resisted when they hurried (in absconding) and you achieved the goals for which they fought,
And they tasted at your hands that which they had not expected.
You were thus incessant and relentless torment on the unbelievers
And you were support and shelter for the believers.
Thus, I swear by Allah that you won its bliss and gained its reward, 
And you attained its merits and prevailed on its worth.
Your argument was never weak and your heart never deviated,
And your sagacity was never feeble, and your determination never cowered, and you never betrayed.
You were as firm as mountain, as storms could never displace you,
And you were as exactly as what was said about you: People felt secure under your government and in what was entrusted with you.
You were also as exactly as what was said about you: modest in your body and strong in carrying out the orders of Allah,
Humble in yourself and enjoying a great standing with Allah,
Great in the earth and lofty in the view of the believers.
None could ever find fault with you, and none could ever speak evil of you,
And you never desired for anyone, And you were never lenient (unfairly) to anyone.
The weak, humble one was strong and mighty in your view until you give him back his right,
And the strong, mighty one was weak in your view until you take the others’ rights from him.
The near and the remote were equal in your view.
You habit was to be right, honest, and kind,
And your words were ruling and determination,
And your custom was forbearance and fortitude,
And your view was knowledge and firmness in whatever you did.
Through you, the right path was taken and the difficult was made easy,
Fires were also extinguished by you and the religion became even at your hands, and Islam and the believers because mighty because of you,
You thus advanced in great strides and stopped and curbed the wrongdoings of those who came after you. 
You are thus too lofty to be mourned and the calamity (of losing you) was so astounding for the inhabitants of the heavens,
And this calamity undermined all people.
Surely, we are Allah's and to Him we shall surely return.
We succumb to Allah’s acts and to His matters do we submit.
By Allah I swear, the calamity of losing you is the ever most catastrophic for the Muslims.
You were haven, shelter, and unshakable fortress of the believers.
And you were, at the same time, rude and furious on the unbelievers.
May Allah join you to His Prophet and may He never deprive us of the reward of our grief for you, and may He never mislead us after you.

47,Ziarat Imam Ali (as) - 1,"Though authoritative chains of authority, It is narrated that Imam `Ali ibn Muhammad al-Hadi (‘a) said the following form of ziy¡rah at the holy tomb of Imam `Ali Amir al-Mu'minin (‘a) on the Ghadir day when he was summoned by the `Abb¡sid ruler, al-Mutasim, to be present before him in Iraq:","Peace be upon Mu¦ammad the Messenger of Allah,
the seal of the Prophets,
the chief of the Messengers,
and the choice of the Lord of the worlds,
whom Allah has entrusted with His Revelations 
and with His determined commandments,
who sealed the previous Messages,
paved the way to the coming blessings,
and Who prevails over all that.
May the mercy, blessings, peace,
benedictions, and greetings of Allah be upon him, too.
Peace be upon the Prophets and Messengers of Allah,
and upon His favorite angels
and righteous saints.
Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful,
the chief of the Prophets’ successors,
the heir of the Prophets’ knowledge,
the friend of the Lord of the worlds,
and my master as well as the master of all of the believers.
May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, too.
Peace be upon you, O my master, O Commander of the Faithful,
the trustee of Allah on His lands,
the envoy of Him amongst His creatures,
and His conclusive argument against His servants.
Peace be upon you, O true religion of Allah
and the straight path of Him.
Peace be upon you, O the Great News
about whom they differ
and they shall be asked.
Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful.
You believed in Allah while they were polytheists,
accepted the truth while they belied it,
strove for the sake of Allah while they refrained,
and worshipped Allah with full sincerity to Him in obedience 
while you were steadfast, depending upon Him totally, until death came upon you.
Verily, curse of Allah be upon the wrongdoers.
Peace be upon you, O chief of the Muslims,
head of the believers,
guide of the pious ones,
and leader of the white-forehead ones.
Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.
I bear witness that you are indeed the brother of Allah’s Messenger,
the successor of him, the heir of his knowledge, 
his trustee on his laws,
his representative in his nation,
and the first to believe in Allah
and to accept as true all that which was revealed to Allah’s Prophet.
I also bear witness that he (i.e. the Prophet) conveyed all that which Allah revealed to him concerning you;
so, he expounded openly what he was commanded (to expound),
declared to his nation the duty of obedience and loyalty to you,
ordered them to swear allegiance to you,
and declared you as enjoying more priority on the believers than that which they enjoy on themselves 
in the same was as Allah has made him enjoy the same.
He then asked Allah the All-exalted to be the witness on them (in this respect),
saying, “Have I conveyed?”
They answered, “Yes, you have. We swear to it by Allah.”
He thus said, “O Allah, be the witness
and You are sufficient Witness and Judge between the servants (0f Yours).”
Hence, curse of Allah be upon him who denied the allegiance to you after he had confessed of it
and upon him who breached his pledge to you after he had taken it.
I also bear witness that you have indeed observed your pledge to Almighty Allah
and that Almighty Allah, in return, shall observe His pledge to you.
“Therefore, whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will grant him a mighty reward.”
I also bear witness that you are truly the commander of the faithful,
the Divine Revelation did declare your commissioned leadership,
and the Messenger made a covenant with the people (that they would be under your leadership).
I also bear witness that you, along with your uncle and brother,
traded with Allah in your souls;
He therefore revealed about you this:
“Surely, Allah has bought of the believers their persons and their property for this,
that they shall have Paradise;
they fight in Allah's way, so they slay and are slain;
a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Bible and the Qur'¡n; 
and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah?
Rejoice therefore in the pledge which you have made; 
and that is the mighty achievement.
They who turn to Allah, who serve Him,
who praise Him, who fast, 
who bow down, who prostrate themselves,
who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, 
and who keep the limits of Allah; and give good news to the believers.”
O Commander of the Faithful, I bear witness
that whoever doubts about you has never believed in the Trusted Messenger,
and whoever leaves you to choose another (as his leader) has indeed diverted the true religion,
that the Lord of the worlds has chosen for us,
and that He completed it on the Ghad¢r Day through (declaring) the Divinely commissioned leadership of you.
And I bear witness that you are the one intended in the following saying of the Almighty, All-merciful Lord:
“And this is My path, the right one; therefore, follow it,
and follow not other ways, for they will lead you away from His way.”
I swear by Allah that whoever follows any one other than you has in fact strayed off the right way and misled others (i.e. those who imitate him),
and that whoever incurs the hostility of you has undoubtedly rejected the right.
O Allah, we have listened to Your command
obeyed, and followed Your straight path;
therefore, (please do) guide us, O our Lord!
And do not cause our hearts to deviate after You have guided us to the obedience to You,
and include us with those who always thank You for Your bounties.
And I also bear witness that you have always been at variance with whimsical desires
as you have always been in line with piety,
you have always been capable of suppressing your rage,
you have always forgiven and pardoned people,
and when Allah is disobeyed, you have always been furious,
and when He is obeyed, you have always been pleased,
and you have always carried out what Allah has commissioned you to do,
you have always observed what has been entrusted with you,
you have always kept what has been confided to you,
you have always conveyed what you were ordered to convey,
and you have always expected that which you were promised.
And I bear witness that as you sometimes conceded some things, you did not do that on account of humiliation, 
and as you sometimes did not demand with your right, you did not do that on account of fear, 
and as you sometimes stopped combating those who usurped your right, you did not do so on account of weakness,
and as you (on a certain occasion) showed contentment to things to which Allah is not pleased, you did not do so on account of flattery,
and you have never been weakened by what befell you for the sake of Allah,
and you have never been feeble and you have never abased yourself as regards demanding with your rights on account of fear. 
I seek Allah’s refuge against such claims;
rather, when you were wronged, you relied upon your Lord in these questions
and entrusted your affair to Him,
and as you reminded them (of their allegiance to you), they did not regard it,
and as you preached them, they did not accept from you,
and as you instructed them to fear Allah, they did not mind.
I also bear witness, O Commander of the Faithful,
that you strove in the way of Allah in the most appropriate way
until Allah summoned you to be in His vicinity,
chose to grasp you, 
and established the argument against your enemies who killed you,
so that you should have argument against them,
although you enjoy conclusive arguments against all of His creatures.
Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful.
You have worshipped Allah sincerely,
striven in the way of Allah steadfastly,
sacrificed yourself, seeking Allah’s judgment,
acted upon His Book,
followed His Prophet’s instructions,
performed the prayers,
paid the zak¡t, 
enjoined what is right,
and forbidden what is wrong as much as you could,
seeking what is possessed by Allah
and desiring for that which Allah has promised.
You have never cared for misfortunes,
never yielded to the hardships,
and never stopped fighting against any warrior on account of fear.
Indeed, whoever claims anything opposite to this to you is actually fabricating
and is forging lies to you,
and whoever leaves your path is drawing himself near to destruction.
You have certainly striven in the way of Allah as exactly as required,
stood harm for the sake of Allah,
have been the foremost to believe in Allah,
the first to offer prayer and to strive,
and the first to expose himself in the land of the polytheists,
while the lands were suffocated with deviation,
Satan was worshipped openly,
and (in the midst of this) you said, “The big number of people that surround me shall never increase my might, 
nor shall their departing me make me feel lonely.
I thus shall never submit even if all peoples desert me.”
Because you resorted to Allah, you were the mightiest,
and because you preferred the Next World to this worldly life, you have been ascetic.
Thus, Allah supported, guided,
chose, and selected you.
Your deeds were never contradictory,
your words were never paradoxical,
your situations were never fickle,
you have never claimed falsely or forged lies against Allah,
you have never been greedy for the wreckage of this world,
you have never been defiled by sins,
you have always had manifest proof from your Lord,
and you have always been certain of what you do,
as you used to guide to the right and to a straight path.
I bear true witness
and I truly swear by Allah
that Mu¦ammad and his Household—may Allah’s blessings be upon them—are the masters of all creatures
and you are indeed my master and the master of all believers,
the servant and friend of Allah,
the brother, successor, and heir of the Messenger,
who used to say to you,
“I swear this by Him Who sent me with the truth: whoever denies you has never believed in me,
whoever rejects you has never confessed of Allah’s existence,
whoever abandons you has actually strayed off,
and whoever is not guided be you has never found the way to Allah or to me. 
Confirming this, my Lord the the Almighty and All-majestic says,
‘Most surely, I am most Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good, 
then follows the right path.’ To follow the right path is to adhere to your Divinely commissioned leadership.”
O master, your favor cannot be concealed
and your light cannot be extinguished.
Verily, he who rejects you shall be the most misfortunate wrongdoer. 
O master, you are the (Divine) claim against the servants,
the guiding to uprightness,
and our means on the Promised Day.
O master, Allah has indeed elevated your standing in this world,
raised your rank in the Hereafter,
and led you to that which has not been seen by those who antagonized you,
those who stood between you and Allah’s gifts to you.
So, curse of Allah be upon those who violated your sanctity
and those who prevented you from taking your right.
I do bear witness that these are the biggest losers
whose faces shall be scorched by Hellfire
and they therein shall be in severe affliction.
And I bear witness that whenever you did something or you avoided doing something,
and whenever you said something or you kept silent;
all these were by the order of Allah and His Messenger.
You thus said, “I swear this by Him Who grasps my soul:
when the Messenger of Allah—peace of Allah be upon him and his Household—
watched me striking (the enemies) with my sword ceaselessly, he said to me,
‘O `Al¢, your position to me is the same as (Prophet) Aaron’s position to (Prophet) Moses;
yet, there shall be no prophet after me.
I would like to further inform you that your death and your lifestyle shall be with me and according to my instruction.’
(Imam `Al¢ continued,) I swear by Allah that I have not told untruth and none shall belie me,
and I have never strayed off and none shall ever mislead me,
and I have never forgotten my Lord’s instructions to me,
and I do follow the true path of my Lord that He showed His Prophet
and the Prophet showed me,
and, most certainly, I am following the lucid path step by step.”
By Allah I swear, true are your words and you have said nothing but the truth.
Curse of Allah be upon those who compare you to your enemies,
while Allah, Whose Name be elevated, says,
“Are those who know and those who do not know alike?”
So, the curse of Allah be upon those who compared you to those whom Allah has ordered to follow your leadership,
while you are the friend of Allah,
the brother of His Messenger,
the defender of His religion,
and the one whose preference (to all others) has been declared by the Qur'¡n;
hence, Almighty Allah says,
“And Allah shall grant to the strivers above the holders back a mighty reward. 
(High) degrees from Him, protection, and mercy. 
And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.”
Almighty Allah has also said,
“Do you make one who undertakes the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque
to be like him who believes in Allah and the latter day and strives hard in Allah's way?
They are not equal with Allah;
and Allah does not guide the unjust people.
Those who believed, fled their homes,
and strove hard in Allah’s way with their property and their souls
are much higher in rank with Allah;
and those are they who are the achievers of their objects.
Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself and His good pleasure
and gardens, wherein lasting blessings shall be theirs;
abiding therein for ever.
Surely, Allah has a mighty reward with Him.”
I bear witness that Allah’s words of praise mean you exclusively
and you are the most sincere in the obedience to Allah
as you have never accepted any alternative for the right guidance
and you have never associated anyone in your worshipping your Lord.
And Almighty Allah has responded the prayer of His Prophet—
peace of Allah be upon him and his Household—concerning you.
He then ordered him to proclaim the position of succeeding him in (the leadership of) his nation,
as a sign of showing your elevated position,
declaration of the evidence on your leadership,
refutation of the false claims,
and repudiation of all excuses.
But when he (i.e. the Prophet) worried about the sedition that would be aroused by the transgressing group due to such declaration
and he did not want you to be faced by the hypocrites,
the Lord of the worlds revealed to him, saying,
“O Messenger! Proclaim the message which has been sent to you from your Lord.
If you did it not, you would not have fulfilled and proclaimed His mission.
And Allah will defend you from men (who mean mischief).”
Accordingly, he (i.e. the Prophet) burdened himself with the loads of (long) walking
and stood up under the burning sun in the midst of the desert,
where he delivered a speech, made everyone listen to him,
and called upon them with rhetorical language.
He then asked them all,
“Have I conveyed (the message)?”
“Yes, you have. We swear it by Allah,” they answered.
“O Allah, be the witness!” the Prophet said.
He then added, “Do I not enjoy more priority to the selves of the believers than that which they enjoy on themselves?”
“Yes, you do,” answered they.
Hen then took you from the hand and said,
“This `Al¢ is now the master of every one who has betaken me as his master.
O Allah, (please do) support those who support `Al¢,
be the enemy of those who incur the hostility of `Al¢,
give victory to those who stand by `Al¢,
and disappoint those who disappoint `Al¢.”
Nevertheless, none believed in what Allah has revealed to His Prophet about you except a few.
Similarly, this (Divinely commissioned) declaration did not increase others but obstinacy.
In defiance of them, Almighty Allah had revealed in this connection:
“O you who believe!
Whoever from among you turns back from his religion, 
then Allah will bring a people. He shall love them and they shall love Him.
(They shall be) lowly before the believers,
mighty against the unbelievers.
They shall strive hard in Allah's way
and shall not fear the censure of any censurer.
This is Allah's favor; He gives it to whom He pleases.
And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.
Only Allah is your Guardian and His Messenger and those who believe:
those who keep up prayers
and give alms while they are in the state of the genuflection of prayer.
And whoever takes Allah and His messenger and those who believe for a guardian,
then, surely, the party of Allah are they that shall be triumphant.”
Our Lord! We believe in what You have revealed and we follow the messenger; 
so, write us down with those who bear witness.
Our Lord! Make not our hearts to deviate after You have guided us aright.
And grant us from Your mercy.
Surely, You are the most liberal Giver.
O Allah, We do realize that this is the truth whose source is You.
So, curse those who object, act arrogantly (towards it),
belie, and deny it. 
And they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back.
Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful,
chief of the Prophets’ successors,
foremost of the worshippers, 
and most ascetic.
May Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.
So be His peace and compliments.
It is you who served a poor man, an orphan, and a prisoner with food on account of your love for Him,
(you did so) for the sake of Allah, while you did not ask for reward or thanks.
Hence, Almighty Allah has revealed the following about you:
“And they prefer them to themselves though poverty may afflict them.
And whoever is preserved from the niggardliness of his soul, these it is that are the successful ones.”
Verily, it is you who is the suppressor of rage
and it is you who is the pardoner of people,
and Allah loves the good-doers.
It is also you who is the steadfast in distress and affliction, as well as in times of conflicts. 
And it is you who distributes things completely equally,
who is just among the subjects,
and the one having full acquaintance with the laws of Allah among all people.
Informing about the favors that He has conferred upon you, Allah the All-exalted says,
“Is he then who is a believer like him who is a transgressor?
They are not equal.
As for those who believe and do good,
the gardens of Paradise are their abiding-place; an entertainment for what they did.”
It is you to whom the knowledge of the Divine Revelation is given exclusively
as well as the laws of true interpretation (of the Holy Qur'¡n)
and the words of the Messenger.
You are known for your unforgettable situations,
renowned positions, 
and memorable events, 
in the Battle of Badr and the Battle of the Allies (al-A¦z¡b):
“When the eyes turned dull, and the hearts rose up to the throats,
and you began to think diverse thoughts of Allah.
There, the believers were tried and they were shaken with severe shaking.
And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease began to say:
‘Allah and His Messenger did not promise us (victory) but only to deceive.’
And when a party of them said,
‘O people of Yathrib! There is no place to stand for you here; therefore, go back.’
And a party of them asked permission of the prophet,
saying: ‘Surely, our houses are exposed.’
And they were not exposed; they only desired to fly away.”
Almighty Allah has also said:
“And when the believers saw the allies, they said:
‘This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us.
And Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.’
And it only increased them in faith and submission.”
On that day, you (O `Al¢) killed their knight, `Amr (ibn `Abd-Wadd)
and defeated their allies:
“And Allah turned back the unbelievers in their rage.
They did not obtain any advantage.
And Allah sufficed the believers in fighting.
And Allah is Strong, Mighty.”
On the Battle of U¦ud: “When they ran off precipitately and did not wait for any one
and the Messenger was calling them from their rear.”
And you were engaged in preventing the polytheists from reaching the Prophet,
on both sides—the right and the left,
until Almighty Allah drove them back, full of fear.
Hence, He gave victory, by means of you, to the disappointing ones.
On the Battle of °unayn, as is accounted by the Divine Revelation:
“When your great numbers made you vain, but they availed you nothing. 
And the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its spaciousness,
then you turned back retreating.
Then, Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers.”
“The believers” were you and your party.
You uncle, al-`Abb¡s, was calling at the defeated party:
“O companions of S£rah al-Baqarah!
O owners of the Allegiance of the Tree!”
He still shouted until a group responded to him, and it was you who replaced them in fighting,
and it was you who aided the Prophet instead of them.
They therefore returned free from reward,
and hoping for repentance, as was promised by Almighty Allah.
He, majestic be His mention, says,
“Then will Allah, after this, turn mercifully to whom He pleases.”
As for you, you were awarded the rank of steadfastness
and prized the great reward.
On the Battle of Khaybar, when Allah exposed the cowardice of the hypocrites
and cut off the roots of the atheists,
so, all praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds (for that):
“And, certainly, they had made a covenant with Allah before, that they would not turn their backs.
And Allah's covenant shall be inquired of.”
O master, you are the conclusive argument (of Allah),
the clear course,
the poured grace,
and the radiant evidence.
So, congratulations, for the favors that Allah has given you.
perdition overtake your enemies, the ignorant!
You presented yourself with the Prophet—peace be upon him and his Household—
during all battles and expeditions that he led;
you always carried the pennon with him
and stroke (the enemies) with your sword before him.
Then, due to your prominent determination
and your sagacity in all affairs,
he (i.e. the Prophet) appointed you as the commander on all occasions,
and you were never under the commandment of another.
On many occasions, your piety prevented you from doing what you had decided about a matter,
while your rival followed his (personal) lust and committed that matter.
Thus, the ignorant ones thought that you were incapable of doing that which had been done by your rival!
I swear by Allah that any one who thought so had missed the right thing and had never found the true guidance.
However, you clarified the misunderstanding in which those who fancied and doubted fell 
by your saying—may Allah’s peace be upon you:
“One who has been through thick and thin of life finds the excuses 
to be preventing him from orders and prohibitions of Allah, 
but he disregards them despite capability (to succumb to them and instead follows the commands of Allah), 
while one who has no restraints of religion seizes the opportunity (and accepts the excuses for not following the commands of Allah).”
You have said the very truth; I swear it by Allah, and the followers of vanity are indeed losers.
And when the two preachers (of their allegiance) tried to deceive you;
and said, “We want to go on `umrah!”
You thus answered them, “I swear by your lives; you do not want to go on `umrah;
rather, you want to betray me!”
Hence, you made covenant with them again
and you renewed their allegiance to you;
but they exerted all efforts to act hypocritically.
And when you drew their attentions to this act, they neglected, redid it again, and did not follow your advice.
Thus, their end result was loss.
After them, the people of Syria (mutinied)! 
So, you went to fight them after you had provided all excuses,
while they did not follow the true religion
neither did they understand the Qur'¡n.
They were rabble, rot, and deviants,
and they were unbelievers in what was revealed to Mu¦ammad about your leadership,
and they were supporters of those who antagonized you.
While, Almighty Allah ordered everyone to follow you
and instructed the believers to support you.
He, the Almighty and All-majestic, has said in this respect:
“O you who believe!
Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the truthful.”
O master, through you did the right manifest itself,
but the people discarded it.
And you made clear the (Prophetic) traditions after they had been eradicated and confused.
Hence, you enjoy the priority of struggling for the sake of confirming the Divine Revelation,
and you enjoy the virtue of struggling for the sake of confirming the true interpretation (of the Divine Revelation).
Your enemy is in fact the enemy of Allah and the denier of Allah’s Messenger.
Your enemy thus calls for vanity, judges unfairly,
usurps the position of rule, and drives his fans to Hellfire.
While `Amm¡r (ibn Y¡sir) strove and called at the two parties (of the battle):
“How eager I am to join Paradise!”
When he then asked for a drink, he was served with a drink of milk; he thus shouted, glorifying Allah, and said:
“The Messenger of Allah—peace of Allah be upon him and his Household—did say to me:
‘The last drink that you will have in this world is a cup of milk,
and the transgressing party will kill you.’”
Thus, Abu’l-`ªdiyah al-Faz¡r¢ faced and killed him.
The curse of Allah
and the curse of all His angels and Messengers be upon this Abu’l-`ªdiyah,
upon any one who unsheathed a sword against you,
and upon any one against whom you unsheathed your sword—
O Commander of the Faithful—
(Curse be upon) the polytheists and the hypocrites up to the Religion Day.
Curse be also upon any one whom is pleased by whatever upsets you,
and curse be upon any one who is not passive for whatever upsets you and upon any one who bypasses and does not deny,
and upon any one who supports your rivals by deeds or words,
and upon any one who fails to support you,
and upon any one who slackens to fight with you,
and upon any one who despises your merits,
and upon any one who denies your right,
and upon any one who leaves you and joins one upon whom Almighty Allah has given you priority.
Allah’s peace, mercy, and blessings,
compliments, and greetings
be upon you and upon the Imams from your Immaculate Household.
Verily, Allah is Praised and Glorious.
What is more astounding
and more horrible than usurping your right
is the usurpation of Fadak from the veracious, pure, and luminous Lady, the doyenne of the women of the world!
As well as the rejection of your testimony and the testimonies of the two masters—your descendants,
and the Household of the Chosen Prophet, may Allah’s peace be upon you all.
Whereas Almighty Allah has elevated you in rank over the nation,
raised your positions,
and demonstrated your preference and honorable favorability over all the created beings.
He thus removed away filth from you and purified you with the most thorough purification.
Allah the Almighty and All-majestic says:
“Indeed, man is created of a hasty temperament.
Being greatly grieved when evil afflicts him
and niggardly when good befalls him,
except those who pray.”
Hence, Almighty Allah has excluded His Chosen Prophet
you, the chief of the Prophets’ successors, from among all His beings.
How deviant from the right he who has wronged you is! 
They then deceptively decided the share of ‘Near of Kin’ to be for you, 
after they wrongly deprived its meritorious people of it.
When the matter (of rule) was returned to you, you continued carrying out what they had decided, 
because you desired for what is stored by Allah for you.
Your ordeals are thus similar to the ordeals encountered by the Prophets, peace be upon them,
who also faced loneliness and absence of supporters.
As you replaced the Prophet by spending that night on his bed instead of him, this situation was similar to the situation of the self-sacrificing Prophet, peace be upon him.
Because you responded (to the Prophet’s order) in the same way as he (i.e. Prophet Ism¡`¢l) responded (to his father’s request),
and you obeyed the Prophet in the same way as (Prophet) Ism¡`¢l obeyed with steadfastness and reliance upon Allah.
Hence, when his father said to him, ‘O my son! Surely, I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you; 
consider then what you see.’
He said, ‘O my father! Do what you are commanded;
if Allah please, you will find me of the patient ones.’
The same situation with you, when the Prophet—peace be upon him and his Household—chose you to replace him,
and ordered you to sleep in his bed instead of him
so that you should protect him by sacrificing yourself for him,
you quickly responded to his request with obedience,
by exposing yourself to killing fearlessly.
So, Allah the All-exalted appreciated this obedience to him
and He, majestic be His mention, declared your excellent deed by saying:
“And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah.”
Then, your ordeal on the Battle of ¯iff¢n,
when books of the Qur'¡n were raised (on spearheads) out of trickery and deception,
causing doubt to be aroused,
the truth to be neglected,
and conjecture to be followed,
this ordeal was similar to the ordeal of (Prophet) Aaron when (Prophet) Moses appointed him as the leader of his people, but they left him alone,
while (Prophet) Aaron was calling at them, saying:
‘O my people! You are only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent Allah.
Therefore, follow me and obey my order.’
They said, ‘We will by no means cease to keep to its worship until Moses returns to us.’
Similarly, when the books of the Qur'¡n were raised (on spearheads), you said:
‘O my people, you are only tried by this and you have been surely cheated.’
Nevertheless, they disobeyed you and did the opposite.
And when they demanded with nominating two arbitrators (one from each party),
you rejected and declared your disavowal of this act before Allah, and then asked them to do whatever they wanted.
Thus, when the truth manifested itself
the wrong was proven as futile,
and they confessed of their flaw and deviation from the right thing,
they also mutinied after that
and obliged you to commit to the nonsensical result of the arbitration that you had rejected and they had accepted,
and you had forbidden it, and they then confessed of the sin that they had committed.
While you were following the course of sagacity and true guidance,
they were following the courses of deviation and blindness.
Nonetheless, they insisted on hypocrisy
and involved themselves in seduction
until Allah made them taste the evil result of their conduct.
He thus deadened, through your sword, those who mutinied against you, causing them eternal misery and perdition,
and He gave life, through your acting as His argument, to those whom He decided as happy; therefore, they were guided (to the true choice).
Allah’s blessings be upon you, coming and going,
and still and moving.
Certainly, no one praising you can ever cover your actual characteristics
and no one criticizing you can ever belittle your merits.
You are verily the best worshipper of all created beings,
the most sincere in asceticism,
and the most enthusiastic defender of the religion.
You executed the laws of Allah with exceptional efforts
and damaged the armies of the apostates with your sword.
You can extinguish the flames of battles with your finger,
tear out the curtains of seditions with your eloquent language,
and distinguish the confusing wrong from the plain right.
You are never influenced by any censure as long as you work for the sake of Allah.
The praising of Allah the All-exalted to you suffices
from the praising of any other one and from the approval of the depicters.
Almighty Allah says:
“Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah.
So, of them is he who accomplished his vow, of them is he who yet waits, and they have not changed in the least.”
After you felt that you had killed the preachers, the wrongdoers, and the apostates,
the predictions of Allah’s Messenger—peace be upon him and his Household—came true,
and you had fulfilled your promise to him, you then said:
“Has time not come yet so that this (beard) shall be dyed with the blood of this (head)?
When will the most unfortunate of them be sent (to slay me)?”
You were always confident that you were proceeding on clear proof from your Lord,
you were acting with sure knowledge of what you do,
you were on your way to Allah,
and you were rejoicing in the bargain that you had made with Him;
and that is the supreme triumph.
O Allah, curse the murderers of your Prophets and the murderers of Your Prophets’ successors 
with the variant curses (that You have prepared for them),
and make those slayers to taste the heat of Your fire.
And also curse those who usurped the right of Your friend,
those who denied their allegiance to him,
and those who rejected him after they had witnessed and declared their loyalty to him
on the day when you completed your religion through him.
O Allah, curse those who slew the Commander of the Faithful,
curse those who wronged him, and curse their adherents and supporters.
O Allah, curse those who wronged and slew al-°usayn,
and curse those who adhered to his enemies and those who supported them,
and curse those who were pleased by the murder of killing al-°usayn and those who disappointed him, with violent cursing.
O Allah, curse the first one to invent the wronging against the Household of Mu¦ammad
and curse those who deprived them of their rights.
O Allah, pour violent curses upon the first one who wronged and usurped the rights of the Household of Mu¦ammad,
and curse all those who followed those wrongdoers up to the Resurrection Day.
O Allah, send blessings upon Mu¦ammad, the seal of the Prophets,
and upon `Al¢, the chief of the Prophets’ successors, and upon his immaculate Household,
(please do) make us adhere to them firmly,
and include us with those who shall be winners and secured because they abode by their leadership;

49,Ziarat H. Muslim Bin Aqeel (as),"Imam Hussain(a.s.)'s caravan left Madina on 28th of Rajab, 60 A.H. and reached Makkah on the 4th of Shabaan. Imam(a.s.) had not yet made up his mind on where to go. For the time being he decided to stay in Meakkah at least until the month of Zil-Hajj and perform the pilgrimage.

The people of Kufa in Iraq heard of what had happened in Madina. Kufa was an important Shiah centre. The Shiahs there had long suffered under Muawiya. They feared even greater sufferings under Yazid. They felt that slowly Islam would be totally destroyed by the greed for power and glory of these two men. They were anxious to preserve the teachings of the Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf). They needed an Imam who would teach the tafseer of the Holy Quran and relate to them the true sayings, ahaadees, of the Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf). They held a meeting in the house of Sulayman bin Surad, a companion of the Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf), and decided to write a letter to Imam Hussain(a.s.) to invite him. Hazrat Salman(a.r.) said in this meeting ""You should be aware that Moawiya has died and Imam Hussain(a.s.) has declined the baiyat (allegiance) of Yazid and he has gone to Makkah. You are his and his father's Shiahs. If you strongly believe that you will not falter in helping him and fighting his enemies then I invite you to write him a letter but if you feel weakness and fear then for God's sake, do not betray a person and endanger his life"".

In this letter they wrote: ""This letter is to Hussain ibn-e-Ali(a.s.) from Sulayman bin Sard, Mussayab bin Najiyah, Rafaah bin Shaddad, Habib ibn-e-Mazahir and other friends among the Muslims and Momineen of Kufa."" This was followed by the information of Moawiya's death and Yazid's becoming caliph. Then they wrote ""We invite you to come to Kufa as we have no Imam to guide us. Through you, Allah will unite us on the path of truth. The Governor of Damascus Noman bin Basheer is in the Dar-al-Amarah but we do not participate in Salat-il-Juma with him neither we pray salt-il-Eid with him. If we know that you are coming then we will force him to get out of here and go back to Syria.""

Abdullah bin Sabie Hamdani and Abdullah bin Daal took this letter to Makkah and gave it to Imam Hussain(a.s.). This was the first letter that reached Imam Hussain(a.s.) on the 10th of Ramzan. In another couple of days, 53 petitions and letters were sent to Imam Hussain(a.s.) by different people through special emissaries including Qais ibne Musheer as-Saydawi, Abdur Rehman bin Abdullah bin Kadan and Ammara bin Abaid Salobi. These were followed up by hundreds of other letters and many special emissaries from the people of Kufa to Imam Hussain(a.s.). The Governor in Kufa was a man called Nu'amaan bin Basheer. Although he was a follower of Muawiya and Yazid, he was not by nature a cruel man. The people of Kufa believed that Imam(a.s.) would be safe in Kufa.

When Imaam Hussain(a.s.) received so many petitions and messages from Kufa he decided to send his cousin Hazrat Muslim bin Aqeel(a.s.) as his emissary to Kufa to study the situation there and report to Imam(a.s.). Imam Hussain(a.s.) would go only if there would be no danger to the people of Kufa or to Imam(a.s.) or any of his companions or family.

He wrote a letter to the people of Kufa and gave it to Hazrat Muslim(a.s.). In this letter Imam(a.s.) said, ""I am sending my cousin and one of the most trusted ones from my family, Muslim ibne Aqeel, to report to me about your affairs. If his report agrees with what you have written I will soon be with you. You must be clear of the fact that the Imam is the one who follows the book of Allah only, and serves Allah in all matters and affairs with justice, honesty and truth and submits to the command of Allah.""

Who was Muslim ibne Aqeel(a.s.)? He was the son of Aqeel ibne Abu Taalib(a.s.) - the real brother of Imam Ali(a.s.). He was a famous warrior. He married Ruqayya binte Imam Ali(a.s.) - Imam Hussain(a.s.)'s sister through another mother. We know of his four children - Abdullah aged about 15 years, Muhammad who was about ten years old, Ibraheem who was eight and young Ruqayya who was just five or six. All these children had travelled with their parents and were in Makkah.

As Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) was preparing for the journey, Imam Hussain(a.s.) went to him and said: ""Muslim, the whole world knows that you are one of the bravest warriors. It is just possible that seeing you in Kufa some people may think that our intention is to fight Yazid. Take your two sons Muhammad and Ibraheem with you. When they see you with such young children, they will know that our intentions are peaceful"".

Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) and his two sons said good-bye to all and left Makkah. Their journey through the desert in the heat of summer was very difficult. They arrived in Kufa towards the end of Ze'Qaad. They were received extremely warmly by the people of Kufa. At the time of his arrival, Sulayman bin Surad was not present in Kufa, therefore, Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) stayed in the house of Mukhtar bin Abi Abaida Saqafi. The news of his arrival spread like wild fire in Kufa and people started visiting him in groups. Very soon more than 18,000 people appeared before Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) and pledged their allegiance to Imam Hussain(a.s.) as their Imam (Tareekh-e-Tabri, Vol.6-Page 211).

It is important to note here that this figure reflects the number of people who pledger allegiance at that time but they were not all true followers and die hard supporters of Imam Hussain(a.s.). Kufa had been ruled by Ziyad and Aal-e-Ziyad for 20 years during which they committed unmatched atrocities on the followers of Ahl-e-Bait(a.s.) and any one known to be sympathetic to Imam Ali(a.s.) was victimized and killed. Under these circumstances, it is correct to conclude that true followers of Imam Ali(a.s.) in that crowd were only a handful and the others had joined them only because they were fedup with the rule of Moawiya and were not in favour of Yazid becoming the next caliph.

Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) reported to Imam Hussain(a.s.) through Abis ibne Shabib that most of the people in Kufa were ready to receive him as their Imam and advised that Imam(a.s.) should proceed to Kufa (Tareekh-e-Tabri, Vol.6, Page211). Amongst the people of Kufa there were many spies employed by Yazid to report to him directly. When Yazid heard from them of the invitations to Imam Hussain(a.s.) and the arrival in Kufa of Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) he was filled with fury. He sent a message to his Governor in Basrah, Ubaydullah ibne Ziyad, to go to Kufa and take over the position of Nu'amaan ibne Basheer. Ibne Ziyad was also told to arrest Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) and kill him and do all that was necessary to suppress the Shiahs in Kufa.

Ibne Ziyad was a cruel, unjust and shrewed man. He kept his journey from Basra to Kufa a secret and just before entering Kufa he covered his face with a black scart so that he could not be recognized. He had a few horsemen in front of him and a few behing him as he entered Kufa. The people of Kufa had been waiting for the arrival of Imam Hussain(a.s.) anxiously and they presumed that the Imam had arrived. Soon people started gathering around him and singing welcoming songs. Ine Ziyad kept observing the people and memorizing faces as the crowd grew and soon it was difficult for his convoy to proceed swiftly. One of his guards, Muslim bin Amr Bahili, shouted ""Clear the way, this is the Amir Ubaidullah ibne Ziyad"". Hearing this, people started running away quickly and when ibne Ziyad reached the Dar-al-Amara only a handful people had been left. Ibne Ziyad arrived in Kufa on the evening of 2nd Zil-Hajj. On the following day he went to the mosque and addressed the people of Kufa. He first announced his appointment as Yazid's governor. He then threatened any one who was engaged in any activity against the government with immediate death, and ordered them to surrender Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) to him.

Ibne Ziyad sealed Kufa in such a way that no one could go in or out of the city without the governor's permission.

Since several people knew that he was staying with Mukhtar Saqafi, Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) decided to move from there as a measure of precaucion and protection. At the invitation of Hani ibn-e-Urwah(a.r.), another leading member of the Shiah community, he moved to Hani's house. This was done secretly and except for a few people no one knew where Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) was. Through a spy, Maaqal, who pretended to be a Shiah, Ibne Ziyad found out where Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) was. Since ibne Ziyad had prior relations with Hani(a.r.), he called him by trick to his palace and got him arrested and thrown into prison. Hazrat Muslaim(a.s.) got the news of Hanis arrest and not wishing to further endanger the lives of his friends, Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) and his two sons left Hani's house. He left the children with Qadhi Shurayb, a judge, and went into the desert to try and get back to Imam Hussain(a.s.) to warn him not to go to Kufa. This was the 7th of Zil-Hajj. That whole day and the following day Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) tried to get out of the city. He found all the exists sealed and guarded by Ibne Ziyad Soldiers.

On the 8th, late in the evening, tired, hungry and exhausted, Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) knocked at the door of a house on the outskirts of the city. A lady opened the door. Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) requested for a little water to quench his thirst. The lady gave him water. When she learnt who he was, she invited him in and offered him shelter for the night. This lady was called Tau'aa. She gave Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) some food and water and took him to a room where he might spend the night.

Late that night Tau'aa's son came home. When he learnt that the man Ibne Ziyad was looking for was in his mother's house, he felt that he would be rewarded by the governor if he got Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) arrested. Unknown to his mother he slipped out in the darkness of the night and gave the information to a captain in ibne Ziyad army. Early the next morning, five hundred soldiers under the leadership of Mohammad bin Ashas surrounded the house of Tau'aa and demanded Hazrat Muslim(a.s.)'s surrender. Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) came out holding his sword. Three times he drove the enemy away and killed 150 men. Twice Ibne Ziyad had to send in reinforcements.

While Hazrat Muslim was fighting, some soldiers went up the rooftops and began throwing stones and lighted torches at him. Others dug a trench in the path of Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) and covered it with grass. Ibne Ziyad told him commanders to trick Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) otherwise it would not be possible to capture him. Although badly wounded and totally exhausted, Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) kept on fighting. As a trick, soldiers of ibne Ziyad offered peace and protection to Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) but he rejected the offer. He was deeply wounded in this tough fight and finally fell into the trench. More than fifty soldiers pounced upon him and chained him. He was dragged to the court of Ibne Ziyad.

Ibne Ziyad told Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) that he would be killed and asked him if he had any last wishes. Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) said: ""I owe a debt which should be discharged by selling off my sword and armour. Secondly I want my body to be given a proper burial. Thirdly I want a message sent to Imam Hussain(a.s.) advising him not to come to Kufa."" Ibne Ziyad agreed to the first request but refused to do anything about the second and third requests. He then ordered Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) to be taken to the roof of the palace to be executed and his body thrown to the ground.

Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) was calm and composed as he was dragged up the steps. He was reciting ""Allahu Akber"" until the last moment. Then there was an absolute silence followed by a thud as the head of Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) was chopped and his body fell to the ground. This was on 9th of Zil-Hajj. Immediately after Hazrat Muslim(a.s.) was martyred, Hani ibn-e-Urwah(a.r.) as well was dragged to the roof top and executed.","Praise be to Allah the evident real master. All the rebel tyrants feel small before His greatness. All the dwellers of the heavens and the earths acknowledge Him as their Lord and every created being believes in His tawhid (oneness).

Blessings which may bring light of joy in their eyes and humiliate and blacken the faces of their enemies among the jinn and men. Salam (salutation) be on you O Muslim bin Aqil bin Abi Talib from Allah, His favourite angels, prophets, messengers, chosen imams, pious servants, martyrs and the truthfuls, and also pure and good congratulation from them, and mercy of Allah be on you. I bear witness that you had established salat, given zakat, advised to do good, prevented from doing evil, sincerely fought in the cause of Allah, and you were killed while striving in His way, till you met the mighty Allah who is happy with your efforts. I bear witness that you have fulfilled covenant made with Allah and gave your life to support the hujjatilah and proof of Allah, the son of His proof, till you died. I bear witness that you obeyed the son of the commissioned prophet, remained loyal to him and advised people to do the same, because he was his exalted grandson, who was a thoroughly learned guide, the executor of the Holy Prophet’s will, the preacher of truth, but was oppressed and wronged. So may Allah give you a reward on behalf of His Messenger, Amir al Muminin, Hassan and Hussain, the best reward for that, which you suffered patiently, remained satisfied and extended unreserved support. So the accomplishment was excellent. May Allah curse him who killed you. May Allah curse him who gave orders to kill you. May Allah curse him who slandered you. May Allah  curse him who remained ignorant of your rights and made light of your honour.May Allah curse him who first took the oath of loyalty and then broke it, forsook you, handed over you to your enemy, instigated people against you, and did not help you. Praise be to Allah who has ordained hell for them as their abode. How terrible it is a place to come live! I bear witness that you had been mercilessly killed and certainly Allah will make good his promise He had made with all of you. I am here as a pilgrim to your holy shrine, aware of your rights; so I submit to all of you, follow your way of life, offer myself to assist you as far as Allah gives orders, so I am with you. I am not with your enemies. Blessings of Allah be on all of you, on yours souls, on your bodies, on your visible existence, on your invisible existence, and peace be on you all, and also His mercy and benedictions. May Allah destroy that group who killed you with their hands and tongues.

Peace be on you O the obedient pious servant of Allah and His Messenger, Amir al Muminin, Hassan and Hussain (peace be on all of them). Praise be to Allah, and peace be on his chosen servants, Muhammad and His children, and also His mercy and benedictions be on them all. May His protection be on your soul and body. I bear witness that you accomplished that against the infidels in the battle of Badr did in the cause of Allah, who were always ready against Allah’s enemies and to help His friends, so may Allah reward you with the best reward, many and abundant rewards; and also to whoso fulfilled the oath of allegiance, accepted His call and obeyed those who were divinely chosen to exercise authority. I bear witness that you left no stone unturned to advise the people to accept the truth and because of your tireless and utmost efforts Allah reckoned you among the martyrs, let your soul, rest in peace with the propitious souls, gave you the best and superior most place in the paradise, exalted your mention in the most honored group, and joined you with the prophets the truthful, martyrs and the pious. How majestic are these companions! I bear witness that neither you lagged behind nor ran away through timidity but carried out your duty on account of your awareness.

When you stop at the door of peace (bab al-salam), which is the gate of the holy shrine, you may face the kiblah direction and repeat three times:

I bear witness that you, being Allah’s friend and argument, strove in Allah’s way in the most appropriate way, followed the course of Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon him and his Household, enjoined that which Allah has deemed lawful, forbade that which Allah has deemed unlawful, carried out His laws, offered the prayers, paid the zakat, enjoined the right, forbade the wrong, and strove in Allah’s way with steadfastness and well-wishing, and with painstakingness and with the intention of seeking the great reward of Allah until death came upon you. So, Allah’s curse be upon those who deprived you of your right and upon those who took you away from your position. Allah’s curse be upon every one who, when informed about this, accepted it. I call Allah, His angels, His Prophets, and His Messengers to witness for me that I am the friend of him who is loyal to you and the enemy of him who antagonizes you. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.

You may then throw yourself on the tomb, kiss it, and say the following words: 
I bear witness that you can hear my words and see my place. And I testify to you, O Allah’s friend, that you conveyed and fulfilled. O my master! O Allah’s argument! O Allah’s trustee! O Allah’s friend! Between me and Allah, to Whom all might and majesty belong, there are sins that have overburdened my back and deprived me of sleep; whenever I remember them, even my insides shiver. I thus flee to Allah, to Whom all might and majesty belong, and to you. I beg you in the name of Him Who has entrusted you with His secrets, appointed you as the supervisor over the affairs of His creatures, matched the obedience to you to the obedience to Him, and matched the loyalty to you to the loyalty to Him that you may intercede for me before Allah, rescue me from Hellfire, and aid me against the vicissitudes of my time. 

You may then throw yourself on the tomb again, kiss it, and say the following words:

I bear witness that you have perished while fully knowing your Lord.

he who deserts you, deserts the Messenger of Allah (S)
he who harms you, harms the Messenger of Allah (S)
he who bestows you (with a favor), bestows (a favor) upon the Messenger of Allah (S) and he who deprive you, deprives the Messenger of Allah (S) (This is) because you are ""part of him and his spirit which lies in his sides.""
Allah, His Messengers and His Apostles are my witnesses that I accept him whom you accept, resent him who you resent; I exonerate myself to Allah from him who you exonerate yourself to Allah from, him who you be friend, hold as my enemy those who you hold (as your enemies), and dislike him who you dislike.
Allah is the best Witness, the best-anticipated One, best Rewarder, and most Bountiful.",,زیارت سیدہ فاطمہ زہرا (س),زیارت حضرت فاطمه زهراء (س),زيارة السيدة فاطمة الزهراء (س),ज़ियारत ऑफ़ ह. फ़ातिमा ज़हरा (स.अ.),Ziarat de H. Fatima Zahra (sa),,,,27
