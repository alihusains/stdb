1,In Praise of God ,"When he (upon him be peace) began to supplicate, he would begin with praise and laudation of God (Mighty and Majestic is He). He would say:","1- Praise belongs to God,
the First, without a first before Him,
the Last, without a last behind Him.

2- Beholders' eyes fall short of seeing Him,
describers' imaginations are not able to depict Him.

3- He originated the creatures through His power with an origination,
He devised them in accordance with His will with a devising.

4- Then He made them walk on the path of His desire, He sent them out on the way of His love.
They cannot keep back
from that to which He has sent them forward,
nor can they go forward
to that from which He has kept them back.

5- He assigned from His provision to each of their spirits a nourishment known and apportioned.
No decreaser decreases those whom He increases, no increaser increases those of them whom He decreases.

6- Then for each spirit He strikes a fixed term in life, for each He sets up a determined end;
he walks toward it through the days of his span,
he overtakes it through the years of his time.
Then, when he takes his final step
and embraces the reckoning of his span,
God seizes him to the abundant reward or the feared punishment to which He has called him,
That He may repay those who do evil for what they have done
and repay those who do good with goodness,1

7- as justice from Him (holy are His names,
and manifest His boons).
He shall not be questioned as to what He does,
but they shall be questioned.2

8- Praise belongs to God, for,
had He withheld from His servants the knowledge to praise Him for the uninterrupted kindnesses with which He has tried them3
and the manifest favours
which He has lavished upon them,
they would have moved about in His kindnesses
without praising Him,
and spread themselves out in His provision
without thanking Him.

9- Had such been the case,
they would have left the bounds of humanity
for that of beastliness
and become as He has described in the firm text of His Book:
They are but as the cattle—nay, but they are further astray from the way!4

10- Praise belongs to God, for the true knowledge of Himself He has given to us,
the thanksgiving He has inspired us to offer Him,
the doors to knowing His Lordship He has opened for us,
the sincerity towards Him in professing His Unity to which He has led us,
and the deviation and doubt in His Command
from which He has turned us aside;

11- a praise through
which we may be given long life
among those of His creatures who praise Him,
and overtake those who have gone ahead
toward His good pleasure and pardon;

12- a praise through which
He will illuminate for us the shadows of the interworld,5
ease for us the path of the Resurrection,
and raise up our stations
at the standing places of the Witnesses6
on the day when every soul will be repaid
for what it has earned -
they shall not be wronged;7
the day a master shall avail nothing a client,
and they shall not be helped;8

13- a praise which will rise up from us to the highest of the 'Illiyun9
in a book inscribed,
witnessed by those brought nigh,10

14- a praise whereby
our eyes may be at rest when sight is dazzled,11
our faces whitened when skins are blackened,12

15- a praise through which
we may be released from God's painful Fire
and enter God's generous neighbourhood,

16- a praise by which
we may jostle the angels brought nigh
and join the prophets, the envoys,
in a House of Permanence that does not remove,
the Place of His Generosity that does not change.

17- Praise belongs to God,
who chose for us the good qualities of creation,
granted us the agreeable things of provision,

18- and appointed for us excellence
through domination over all creation;
every one of His creatures submits to us
through His power
and comes to obey us
through His might.13

19- Praise belongs to God,
who locked for us the gate of need
except toward Him.
So how can we praise Him? When can we thank Him? Indeed, when?

20- Praise belongs to God,
who placed within us the organs of expansion,
assigned for us the agents of contraction, gave us to enjoy the spirits of life,
fixed within us the limbs of works,
nourished us with the agreeable things of provision,
freed us from need through His bounty,
and gave us possessions through His kindness.

21- Then He commanded us that He might test our obedience
and prohibited us that He might try our thanksgiving.
So we turned against the path of His commandments and mounted the backs of His warnings.
Yet He hurried us not to His punishment,
nor hastened us on to His vengeance.
No, He went slowly with us through His mercy,
in generosity, and awaited our return through His clemency, in mildness.

22- Praise belongs to God,
who showed us the way to repentance,
which we would not have won save through His bounty.
Had we nothing to count as His bounty but this,
His trial of us would have been good, His beneficence toward us great,
His bounty upon us immense.

23- For such was not His wont in repentance
with those who went before us.14
He has lifted up from us
what we have not the strength to bear,15
charged us only to our capacity,16
imposed upon us nothing but ease,
and left none of us with an argument or excuse.

24- So the perisher among us is he who perishes in spite of Him
and the felicitous among us he who beseeches Him.

25- And praise belongs to God
with all the praises of
His angels closest to Him,
His creatures most noble in His eyes,
and His praisers most pleasing to Him;

26- a praise that may surpass other praises
as our Lord surpasses all His creatures.

27- Then to Him belongs praise,
in place of His every favour upon us
and upon all His servants, past and still remaining,
to the number of all things His knowledge encompasses,
and in place of each of His favours,
their number doubling and redoubling always and forever, to the Day of Resurrection;

28- a praise whose bound has no utmost end,
whose number has no reckoning,
whose limit cannot be reached,
whose period cannot be cut off;

29- a praise which will become
a link to His obedience and pardon,
a tie to His good pleasure,
a means to His forgiveness,
a path to His Garden,
a protector against His vengeance,
a security against His wrath,
an aid to obeying Him,
a barrier against disobeying Him,
a help in fulfilling His right and His duties;

30- a praise that will make us felicitous
among His felicitous friends,
and bring us into the ranks
of those martyred by the swords of His enemies.
He is a Friend, Praiseworthy!",(Supplication - 1),sajjadiyya_01.mp3,1,1,خداوند عالم کی حمد و ستائش,دعا در توحید و ستایش خداوند,1-  التَّحْمِيدُ لِلَّهِ عَزَّ وجَلَّ.,जब आप दुआ मांगते तो उसकी इब्तिदा ख़ुदाए बुज़ुर्ग व बरतर की हम्द व सताइश से फ़रमाते,Louange à Allah,D,,,,,

1- Praise belongs to God
who was kind to us through Muhammad
(God bless him and his Household)

displaying thereby His power,
which nothing can render incapable,
though it be great,
and nothing can escape,
though it be subtle.

2- He sealed through us all He created,
appointed us witnesses over those who deny,
and increased us by His kindness over those who are few.

16- migrated to the land of exile and the place of remoteness from the home of his saddlebags,
the walkway of his feet,
the ground of his birth,
and the intimate abode of his soul,
desiring to exalt Thy religion
and seeking help
against those who disbelieved in Thee,

17- until what he attempted against Thy enemies
went well with him

18- and what he arranged for Thy friends
was accomplished.

19- He rose up against them seeking victory
through Thine aid, becoming strong in spite of his weakness with Thy help.

20- He fought against them
in the centre of their cities

21- and attacked them
in the midst of their dwellings,

22- until Thy command prevailed,
and Thy word rose up,
though the idolaters were averse.1

23- O God, so raise him, because of his labours for Thy sake, to the highest degree of Thy Garden,2

24- that none may equal him in station,
none may match him in level,
and no angel brought nigh or prophet sent out
may parallel him in Thy sight.

1- O God, as for the followers of the messengers
and those of the people of the earth
who attested to them unseen
(while the obstinate resisted them through crying lies) -
they yearned for the emissaries through the realities of faith,

2- in every era and time in which Thou didst send a messenger
and set up for the people a director
from the period of Adam down to Muhammad
(God bless him and his Household)
from among the imams of guidance
and the leaders of the godfearing (upon them all be peace) -
remember them with forgiveness and good pleasure!

3- O God,
and as for the Companions of Muhammad specifically,
those who did well in companionship,
who stood the good test in helping him,
responded to him when he made them hear his messages' argument,

4-separated from mates and children
in manifesting his word,
fought against fathers and sons in strengthening his prophecy,
and through him gained victory;

5- those who were wrapped in affection for him,
hoping for a commerce
that comes not to naught1 in love for him;

6- those who were left by their clans
when they clung to his handhold
and denied by their kinsfolk
when they rested in the shadow of his kinship;

7- forget not, O God,
what they abandoned for Thee and in Thee,
and make them pleased with Thy good pleasure
for the sake of the creatures they drove to Thee
while they were with Thy Messenger,
summoners to Thee for Thee.

and going out from a plentiful livelihood to a narrow one,
and [show gratitude to] those of them who became objects of wrongdoing and whom Thou multiplied in exalting Thy religion.

who say, Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers
who went before us in faith,2
Thy best reward;

10- those who went straight to the Companions' road, sought out their course,
and proceeded in their manner.

11- No doubt concerning their sure insight diverted them
and no uncertainty shook them
from following in their tracks
and being led by the guidance of their light.

12- As their assistants and supporters,
they professed their religion,
gained guidance through their guidance,
came to agreement with them,
and never accused them in what they passed on to them.

13- O God, and bless the Followers,
from this day of ours to the Day of Doom,
their wives, their offspring,
and those among them who obey Thee,

14- with a blessing through which
Thou wilt preserve them from disobeying Thee,
make room for them in the plots of Thy Garden,
defend them from the trickery of Satan,
help them in the piety in which they seek help from Thee,
protect them from sudden events that come by night and day - except the events which come with good -

15- and incite them, through it (this blessing), to
tie firmly the knot of good hope in Thee,
desire what is with Thee,
and refrain from ill thoughts [toward Thee]
because of what the hands of Thy servants' hold.

16- Thus Thou mayest restore them to beseeching Thee and fearing Thee,
induce them to renounce the plenty of the immediate,
make them love to work for the sake of the deferred
and prepare for what comes after death,

on the day when souls take leave from bodies,

give me from Thyself mercy and wholesome relief,
and appoint for me from Thyself a quick way out!

9- Distract me not through worry
from observing Thy obligations
and acting in accordance with Thy prescriptions.

10- My capacity has been straitened, my Lord,
by what has come down on me,
and I am filled with worry by carrying what has happened to me,
while Thou hast power to remove what has afflicted me
and to repel that into which I have fallen.

8,In Seeking Refuge,"His Supplication in Seeking Refuge from Hateful Things, Bad Moral Qualities, and Blameworthy Acts","1- O God, I seek refuge in Thee from
the agitation of craving,
the violence of wrath, the domination of envy,
the frailty of patience,
the lack of contentment, surliness of character,
urgency of passion, the disposition to vehemence,

2- following caprice,1
opposing guidance,
the sleep of heedlessness,
undertaking the toilsome,
preferring falsehood over truth,
persisting in sin,
making little of disobedience,
making much of obedience,

3- vying with the wealthy,
disparaging the poor,
guarding badly over those in our hands,
failing to thank those who have done good to us,

4- aiding a wrongdoer,
abandoning someone troubled,
wanting what is not rightfully ours,
and speaking about knowledge without knowing.

5- We seek refuge in Thee from
harbouring dishonesty toward anyone,
being pleased with our works,
and stretching out our expectations.

6- We seek refuge in Thee from
ill-mindedness,
looking down on the small,
Satan's gaining mastery over us,
time's afflicting us,
and the sovereign's oppressing us.

7- We seek refuge in Thee from
acting with prodigality
and not having sufficiency.

8- We seek refuge in Thee from
the gloating of enemies,
indigent need for equals,
living in hardship,
and dying without readiness.

9- We seek refuge in Thee from
the most dreadful remorse,
the greatest affliction, the most wretched wretchedness, the evil end to the journey,
the deprivation of reward,
and the advent of punishment.

make us go to the repentance that Thou lovest
and make us leave the persistence that Thou hatest!

2- O God, when we halt before two decreases,
in religion or in this world,
let the decrease fall upon that which passes quickly
and relent in that which lasts the longer!

3- When we set out after two concerns,
one of which makes Thee pleased with us
and the other of which displeases Thee,
incline us toward that which makes Thee pleased and weaken our strength in that which displeases Thee!

4- Leave not our souls alone to choose in that,
for they choose falsehood
except inasmuch as Thou givest success,
and they command to evil
except inasmuch as Thou hast mercy!1

5- O God,
thou created us from frailty,2
built us up from feebleness,
and began us from a mean water;3
we have no force except through Thy strength
and no strength except through Thy help.

6- So confirm us by giving us success,
point us the right way by Thy pointing,
blind the eyes of our hearts
toward everything opposed to Thy love,
and set not in any of our limbs
passage to disobeying Thee!

7- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and assign
the whisperings of our hearts,
the movements of our members,
the glances of our eyes,
and the idioms of our tongues,
to that which makes incumbent Thy reward,
lest a good deed slip by us, through which we might deserve Thy repayment,

10,In Seeking Asylum with God,His Supplication in Seeking Asylum with Allah (Exalted is He),"1- O God, if Thou willest,
Thou wilt pardon us through Thy bounty
and if Thou willest,
Thou wilt chastise us through Thy justice.

2- So make our ways smooth to Thy pardon
through Thy kindness
and grant us sanctuary from Thy chastisement
through Thy forbearance,
for none of us has the endurance for Thy justice
and none of us can reach deliverance without Thy pardon!

3- O Richest of the rich!
Here we are, Thy servants, before Thee.
I am the neediest of the needy toward Thee,
so redress our neediness through Thy plenty
and cut us not off from our hopes
through Thy withholding,
lest Thou makest wretched him who seeks felicity through Thee
and deprivest him who seeks help from Thy bounty!

4- Then to whom would we return after Thee?
Where would we go from Thy gate?
Glory be to Thee!
We are the distressed,
the response to whom
Thou hast made incumbent,
the people from whom
Thou hast promised to remove the evil.1

5- That thing most resembling Thy will
and that affair most worthy for Thee in Thy mightiness
is showing mercy to him who asks Thee for mercy
and helping him who seeks help from Thee.
So show mercy upon our pleading with Thee
and free us from need when we throw ourselves before Thee!

11,For Good Outcomes,His Supplication for Good Outcomes,"1- O He remembering whom brings honour
to those who remember!
O He thanking whom brings triumph
to those who give thanks!
O He obeying whom brings deliverance

Bless Muhammad and his Household,
and divert our hearts through remembering Thee
from every act of remembrance,
our tongues through thanking Thee
from every act of thanksgiving,
our limbs through obeying Thee
from every act of obedience!

2- If Thou hast ordained for us idleness from these occupations,
make it an idleness of safety, within which no ill consequence visits us or weariness overtakes us!
Then the writers of evil deeds may depart from us with a page empty of the mention of our evil deeds,
and the writers of good deeds may turn away from us happy with the good deeds of ours which they have written.

3- And when the days of our life have passed by,
the terms of our lifetimes have elapsed,
and Thy call, which must come and be answered, summons us forth,
then bless Muhammad and his Household
and make the outcome of what the writers of our works count against us
an accepted repentance,
which afterwards gave us no rest
in a sin that we committed
or an act of disobedience that we performed!

with which Thou hast covered over the heads of the witnesses
on the day when the records of Thy servants are tried!

12,In Confession and Seeking Repentance,His Supplication in Confession and in Seeking Repentance toward God,"1- O God,
three traits have prevented me from asking Thee
and one trait has urged me on:

2- I am prevented by a command Thou hast commanded in which I have been slow,
a prohibition Thou hast prohibited toward which I have hurried,
and a favour through which Thou hast favoured
for which I have not given sufficient thanks.

3- I am urged to ask Thee
by Thy gratuitous bounty upon him who
turns his face toward Thee
and comes to Thee with a good opinion,
since all Thy beneficence is gratuitous bounty
and every one of Thy favours a new beginning!

4- So here I am, my God,
standing at the gate of Thy might,
the standing of the lowly, the surrendered,
asking Thee in my shame,
the asking of the destitute, the pitiful,

5- admitting to Thee that
at the time of Thy beneficence I surrendered not
save through abstaining from disobedience toward Thee
and in none of my states was I ever without
Thy Kindness.

6- Will it profit me, my God,
to admit to Thee the evil of what I have earned?
Will it save me from Thee
to confess the ugliness of what I have done?
Or wilt Thou impose upon me in this my station
Thy displeasure?
Will Thy hate hold fast to me in the time of
my supplication?

7- Glory be to Thee! I do not despair of Thee, for Thou hast opened the door of repentance toward Thyself.
Rather, I say, the words of a lowly servant,
having wronged himself
and made light of his Lord's inviolability,

8- and whose sins are dreadful, great,
whose days have parted, fled,
until, when he sees the term of his works expired
and the limit of his lifetime reached
and knows with certainty that he has no escape from Thee,
no place to flee from Thee,
he turns his face toward Thee in repeated turning,
makes his repentance toward Thee sincere,
stands before Thee with a pure and purified heart,
then supplicates Thee with a feeble, quiet voice.

9- He is bowed before Thee, bent,
his head lowered, thrown down,
his legs shaking in fear,
his tears flooding his cheeks.
He supplicates Thee:
O Most Merciful of the merciful!
O Most Merciful of those toward whom seekers of mercy keep on turning!
O Tenderest of those around whom run
seekers of forgiveness!
O He whose pardon is greater than His vengeance!
O He whose good pleasure is more abundant
than His anger!1

10- O He who seeks His creatures' praise
with excellent forbearance!
O He who has accustomed His servants
to the acceptance of their repeated turningl!2
O He who seeks to heal their corruption
through repentance!
O He who is pleased with the easy of their acts!
O He who recompenses with the much their little !
O He who has made himself accountable to them to respond to supplication!3
O He who pledged Himself by His gratuitous bounty to give them excellent repayment!

11- I am not the most disobedient of those who have disobeyed Thee and whom Thou hast forgiven,
nor am I the most blameworthy to offer excuses
which Thou hast accepted,
nor am I the most wrongdoing of those who have
repented to Thee,
and to whom Thou hast returned

12- I repent to Thee in this my station,
the repentance of one
remorseful over what preceded from him hastily,
apprehensive of what has gathered around him,
pure in shame for that into which he has fallen,

13- knowing that pardoning great sins is nothing great for Thee.4
overlooking enormous misdeeds is not difficult for Thee,
putting up with indecent crimes does not trouble Thee,
and the most beloved of Thy servants to Thee is he who refrains from arrogance before Thee,
pulls aside from persistence,
and holds fast to praying forgiveness!

14- I am clear before Thee of arrogance,
I seek refuge in Thee from persistence,
I pray forgiveness from Thee for shortcomings,
I seek help from Thee in incapacity!

15- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
dispense with what is incumbent upon me toward Thee,
release me from what I merit from Thee,
and grant me sanctuary from what the evildoers fear!
For Thou art full of pardon,
the hoped-for source of forgiveness,
well known for Thy forbearance.
My need has no object but Thee, .
my sin no forgiver other than Thee -could that be possible?

16- I have no fear for myself except from Thee;
Thou art worthy of reverential fear,
and worthy to forgive!5
Bless Muhammad and his Household, grant my need,
answer my request favourably, forgive my sin,
and give me security from fear for myself!
Thou art powerful over everything,6
and that is easy for Thee.

13,In Seeking Needs from God,His Supplication in Seeking Needs from Allah (exalted is He),"1- O God,
O ultimate object of needs!

2- O He through whom requests are attained!

3- O He whose favours are not bought
by prices!

4- O He who does not muddy His gifts
by the imposition of obligations!

5- O He along with whom nothing is needed
and without whom nothing can be done!

6- O He toward whom desire is ever directed
and never turned away!

7- O He whose treasuries cannot be exhausted
by demands!

8- O He whose wisdom cannot be altered
by any means!

9- O He from whom the needs of the needy
are never cut off!

10- O He who is not distressed
by the supplications of the supplicators!

11- Thou hast lauded Thyself for having no need for Thy creatures,
and it suits Thee to have no need for them,

12- and Thou hast attributed to them poverty,
and it suits them to be poor toward Thee.1

13- So he who strives to remedy his lack through what is with Thee
and wishes to turn poverty away from himself through Thee
has sought his need in the most likely place
and come to his request from the right quarter.

14- But he who turns in his need toward one of Thy creatures
or assigns the cause of its being granted to other than Thee,
has exposed himself to deprivation
and deserves to miss Thy beneficence.

15- O God, I have a need of Thee:
My exertion has fallen short of it
and my stratagems have been cut back before reaching it.
My soul induced me to present it to him who presents his needs to Thee
and can do nothing without Thee in his requests, but this is one of the slips of the offenders,
one of the stumbles of the sinners!

16- Then through Thy reminding me,
I was aroused from my heedlessness,
through Thy giving success,
I stood up from my slip,
and through Thy pointing the way,
I returned and withdrew from my stumble.

17- I said: Glory to my Lord!
How can the needy ask from the needy?
How can the destitute beseech the destitute?

18- So I went straight to Thee, my God, in beseeching,
and I sent Thee my hope with trust in Thee.

19- I came to know that
the many I request from Thee are few before Thy wealth,
the weighty I ask from Thee is vile before Thy plenty;
Thy generosity is not constrained by anyone's asking,
Thy hand is higher in bestowing gifts than every hand!

20- O God, so bless Muhammad and his Household,
take me through Thy generosity to Thy gratuitous bounty
and take me not through Thy justice
to what I deserve!
I am not the first beseecher to beseech Thee
and Thou bestowed upon him
while he deserved withholding,
nor am I the first to ask from Thee
and Thou wast bounteous toward him
while he merited deprivation.

21- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
respond to my supplication, come near my call,
have mercy on my pleading,
listen to my voice,

22- cut not short my hope for Thee,
sever not my thread to Thee,
turn not my face in this my need,
and other needs,
away from Thee,

23- attend for my sake to
the fulfillment of my request,
the granting of my need,
and the attainment of what I have asked
before I leave this place
through Thy making easy for me the difficult
and Thy excellent ordainment for me in all affairs!

24- Bless Muhammad and his Household
with a permanent, ever-growing blessing,
whose perpetuity has no cutting off
and whose term knows no limit,
and make that a help to me
and a cause for the granting of my request!
Thou art Boundless, Generous!

25- And of my needs, My Lord, are such and such.
HERE YOU SHOULD STATE YOUR NEEDS,
THEN PROSTRATE YOURSELF,
AND SAY IN YOUR PROSTRATION
Thy bounty has comforted me
and Thy beneficence has shown the way,

14,In Suffering Acts of Wrongdoing,His Supplication when Hostility was Shown to Him or when he Saw what he did not Like in Wrongdoers,"1- O He from whom is not concealed
news of the aggrieved!

2- O He who has no need to be told about them
by the witnessing of the witnesses!

3- O He who whose help is near to the wronged!

4- O He whose aid is far from the wrongdoers!

5- Thou knowest, my God,
how so-and-so, son of so-and-so, has harmed me
in that which Thou hast forbidden,
and how he has violated me
in that which Thou hast prohibited,
showing thereby ingratitude toward Thy favour upon him
and delusion concerning what Thou hast denied him.

6- O God,
so bless Muhammad and his Household,
keep my wrongdoing enemy from wronging me through Thy strength,
blunt his blade toward me through Thy power,
and assign to him
a diversion in that which is close to him
and the inability to reach his enemy!

7- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
let the wrongdoer not find it easy to wrong me,
give me good help against him,
preserve me from the like of his acts,
and place me not in the like of his situation!

8- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
and assist me with an immediate assistance
that will heal my rage toward him
and redeem my fury toward him!

9- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
compensate me for his wronging me with Thy pardon
and replace his evil action toward me with Thy mercy,
for every detested thing less than Thy anger is slight
and every disaster next to Thy rancour indifferent!

10- O God,
just as Thou hast made me detest being wronged,
so also protect me from doing wrong!

11- O God,
I complain to no one but Thee,
and I seek help from no ruler other than Thee -
how could I?
So bless Muhammad and his Household,
join my supplication to response,
and unite my complaint with change!

12- O God,
tempt me not with despair of Thy just treatment
and tempt him not with feeling secure from Thy disapproval,
lest he persist in wronging me
and constrain me in my rights.2
Let him soon recognize
what Thou hast promised the wrongdoers3
and let me recognize Thy promised response to the distressed!4

13- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
give me success in accepting Thy decrees
for me and against me,
make me pleased with what Thou takest
for me and from me,
guide me to that which is most upright
and employ me in that which is safest!

14- O God, if the best for me with Thee lies
in delaying the taking to task for my sake
of him who has wronged me
and in refraining from vengeance toward him
until the Day of Decision and
the Gathering of Disputants,
then bless Muhammad and his Household,
strengthen me from Thee
with true intention and lasting patience,

15- give me refuge from evil desire and the impatience of the greedy,
and form in my heart the image of
Thy reward which Thou hast stored away for me
and the repayment and punishment
which Thou has prepared for my disputant!
Make this a cause of my contentment
with what Thou hast decreed
and my trust
in what Thou hast chosen!

15,When Sick,His Supplication when Sick or Visited by Distress or an Affliction,"1- O God, to Thee belongs praise
for the good health of my body
which lets me move about,
and to Thee belongs praise,
for the ailments
which Thou causest to arise in my flesh!

2- For I know not, my God,
which of the two states deserves more my thanking Thee
and which of the two times is more worthy for my praise of Thee:

3- the time of health,
within which Thou makest me delight in the agreeable things of Thy provision,
through which Thou givest me the joy to seek
the means to Thy good pleasure and bounty,
and by which Thou strengthenest me
for the acts of obedience
which Thou hast given me success to accomplish;

4- or the time of illness
through which Thou puttest me to the test
and bestowest upon me favours:
lightening of the offenses
that weigh down my back,
purification of the evil deeds
into which I have plunged,
incitement to reach for repentance,
reminder of the erasure of misdeeds through ancient favour;

5- and, through all that, what the two writers write for me:
blameless acts,
which no heart had thought,
no tongue had uttered,
and no limb had undertaken,
rather, as Thy bestowal of bounty upon me
and the beneficence of Thy benefaction toward me.1

6- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
make me love what Thou hast approved for me,
make easy for me what Thou hast sent down upon me,
purify me of the defilement of what I have sent ahead,
erase the evil of what I have done beforehand,
let me find the sweetness of well-being,
let me taste the coolness of safety,
and appoint for me
a way out from my illness to Thy pardon,
transformation of my infirmity into Thy forbearance,
escape from my distress to Thy refreshment,
and safety from this hardship in Thy relief!

16,In Asking for Release from Sins,His Supplication when he Asked Release from his Sins or Pleaded in Seeking Pardon for his Defects,"1- O God,
O He through whose Mercy sinners seek aid!

2- O He to the remembrance of whose beneficence the distressed flee!

3- O He in fear of whom the offenders weep!

4- O Comfort of every lonely stranger!
O Relief of all who are downcast and distressed!
O Aid of everyone abandoned and alone!
O Support of every needy outcast!

5- Thou art He
who embracest everything in mercy and knowledge!1

6- Thou art He
who hast appointed for each creature a share of Thy favours!

7- Thou art He
whose pardon is higher than His punishment!

8- Thou art He
whose mercy runs before His wrath!

9- Thou art He
whose bestowal is greater than His withholding!

10- Thou art He
by whose mercy all creatures are embraced!

11- Thou art He
who desires no repayment by him upon whom He bestows!

12- Thou art He
who does not overdo the punishment of him who disobeys Thee!

13- And I, my God, am Thy servant
whom Thou commanded to supplicate
and who said:
I am at Thy service and disposal!
Here am I, my Lord,
thrown down before Thee.

14- I am he
whose back offenses have weighed down!
I am he
whose lifetime sins have consumed!
I am he
who was disobedient in his ignorance,
while Thou didst not deserve that from him!

15- Wilt Thou, my God,
be merciful toward him who supplicates Thee,
that I should bring my supplication before Thee?
Wilt Thou forgive him who weeps to Thee
that I should hurry to weep?
Wilt Thou show forbearance toward
him who puts his face in the dust before Thee in lowliness?
Wilt Thou free from need him who complains to Thee of his indigent need with confidence?

16- My God,
disappoint not him who finds no bestower
other than Thee,
and abandon not him who cannot be freed from his need for Thee through less than Thee!

17- My God,
so bless Muhammad and his Household,
turn not away from me
when I have turned my face toward Thee,
deprive me not
when 1 have besought Thee,
and slap not my brow with rejection
when I have stood before Thee!

18- Thou art He who has described Himself by mercy,
so bless Muhammad and his Household
and have mercy upon me!
Thou art He who has named Himself by pardon,
so pardon me!

19- Thou hast seen, my God,
the flow of my tears
in fear of Thee,
the throbbing of my heart in dread of Thee,
and the infirmity of my limbs in awe of Thee.

20- All this from my shame before Thee
because of my evil works!
So my voice has become silent,
no longer crying to Thee,
and my tongue has gone dumb,
no longer whispering in prayer.

21- My God, so to Thee belongs praise!
How many of my flaws Thou hast covered over
without exposing me!
How many of my sins Thou hast cloaked
without making me notorious!
How many faults I have committed, yet Thou didst not
tear away from me their covering,
collar me with their detested disgrace,
or make their dishonour plain
to those of my neighbours who search for my defects
and to those who envy Thy favour toward me!

22- But that did not prevent me from passing on
to the evil that Thou knowest from me!

23- So who is more ignorant than I, my God,
of his own right conduct?
Who is more heedless than I
of his own good fortune?
Who is further than I
from seeking to set himself right?
For I spend the provision Thou deliverest to me
in the disobedience Thou hast prohibited to me!
Who sinks more deeply into falsehood
and is more intensely audacious in evil than I?
For I hesitate between Thy call and the call of Satan
and then follow his call
without being blind in my knowledge of him
or forgetful in my memory of him,

24- while I am certain that Thy call takes to the Garden
and his call takes to the Fire!

25- Glory be to Thee!
How marvellous the witness I bear against my own soul
and the enumeration of my own hidden affairs!

26- And more marvellous than that is Thy lack of haste with me,
Thy slowness in attending to me!
That is not because I possess honour with Thee,
but because Thou waitest patiently for me
and art bountiful toward me
that I may refrain from disobedience displeasing to Thee
and abstain from evil deeds that disgrace me,
and because Thou lovest to pardon me more than to punish!

27- But I, my God, am more numerous in sins,
uglier in footsteps, more repulsive in acts,
more reckless in rushing into falsehood,
weaker in awakening to Thy obedience,
and less attentive and heedful toward Thy threats,
than that I could number for Thee my faults
or have the power to recount my sins.

28- I only scold my own soul,
craving Thy gentleness,
through which the affairs of sinners are set right,
and hoping for Thy mercy,
through which the necks of the offenders are freed.

29- O God,
this is my neck,
enslaved by sins,
bless Muhammad and his Household
and release it through Thy pardon!
This is my back,
weighed down by offenses,
bless Muhammad and his Household
and lighten it through Thy kindness!

30- My God,
were I to weep to Thee until my eyelids drop off,
wail until my voice wears out,
stand before Thee until my feet swell up,
bow to Thee until my backbone is thrown out of joint,
prostrate to Thee until my eyeballs fall out,
eat the dirt of the earth for my whole life,
drink the water of ashes till the end of my days,
mention Thee through all of that until my tongue fails,
and not lift my glance to the sky's horizons in shame before Thee,
yet would I not merit through all of that
the erasing of a single one of my evil deeds!

31- Though Thou forgivest me when I merit Thy forgiveness
and pardonest me when I deserve Thy pardon,
yet I have no title to that through what I deserve,
nor am I worthy of it through merit,
since my repayment from Thee
from the first that I disobeyed Thee
is the Fire!
So if Thou punishest me,
Thou dost me no wrong.

32- My God, since Thou hast
shielded me with Thy covering
and not exposed me,
waited patiently for me through Thy generosity,
and not hurried me to punishment,
and shown me clemency through Thy bounty,
and not changed Thy favour upon me
or muddied Thy kindly acts toward me,
have mercy on my drawn out pleading,
my intense misery,
and my evil situation!

33- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
protect me from acts of disobedience,
employ me in obedience,
provide me with excellent turning back [to Thee],
purify me through repentance,
strengthen me through preservation from sin,
set me right through well being,
let me taste the sweetness of forgiveness,
make me the freedman of Thy pardon
and the slave released by Thy mercy,
and write for me a security
from Thy displeasure!
Give me the good news of that
in the immediate, not the deferred
- a good news I recognize -
and make known to me therein a sign
which I may clearly see!

34- That will not constrain Thee in Thy plenty,
distress Thee in Thy power,
ascend beyond Thy lack of haste,
or tire Thee in Thy great gifts,
which are pointed to by Thy signs.

Thou decreest what Thou desirest.

17,Against Satan,His Supplication when he Mentioned Satan and Sought Refuge from him and from his Enmity and Trickery,"1- O God,
we seek refuge in Thee
from the instigations of the accursed Satan,
his trickery, and his traps,
from trust in his false hopes, his promises,
his delusions, and his snares,

2- and lest he should make himself crave
to lead us away from Thy obedience
and to degrade us through our disobeying Thee,
and lest what he has shown us as beautiful be beautiful for us
and what he has shown us as detestable weigh down upon us.

3- O God, drive him away from us through Thy worship,
throw him down through our perseverance in Thy love,
and place between him and us a covering that he cannot tear away
and a solid barrier that he cannot cut through!

4- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
distract Satan from us with some of Thy enemies,
preserve us from him through Thy good guarding,
spare us his treachery,
turn his back toward us,
and cut off from us his trace!

5- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
give us to enjoy guidance
the like of his misguidance,
increase us in piety
against his seduction,
and make us walk in reverential fear
contrary to his path of ruin!

6- O God, assign him no place of entrance into our hearts
and do not allow him to make his home in that which is with us!

7- O God, cause us to recognize the falsehood with which he tempts us,
and once Thou hast caused us to recognize it,
protect us from it!
Make us see what will allow us to outwit him,
inspire us with all that we can make ready for him,
awaken us from the heedless slumber of relying upon him,
and help us well, through Thy giving success, against him!

8- O God, saturate our hearts with the rejection of his works
and be gentle to us by destroying his stratagems!

9- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
turn his authority away from us,
cut off his hope from us,
and keep him from craving for us!

10- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
and place our fathers, our mothers, our children, our wives,
our siblings, our relatives,
and the faithful among our neighbours,
male and female,
in a sanctuary impregnable to him,
a guarding fortress, a defending cave!
Clothe them in shields protective against him
and give them arms that will cut him down!

11- O God, include in that everyone who
witnesses to Thee as Lord,
devotes himself sincerely to Thy Unity,
shows enmity toward him
through the reality of servanthood,
and seeks help from Thee against him
through knowledge of the divine sciences!

12- O God, undo what he ties,
unstitch what he sews up,
dislocate what he devises,
frustrate him when he makes up his mind,
and destroy what he establishes!

13- O God, rout his troops,
nullify his trickery,
make his cave collapse,
and rub his nose in the ground!

14- O God,
place us in the ranks of his enemies
and remove us from the number of his friends,
that we obey him not when he entices us
and answer him not when he calls to us!
We command everyone who obeys our command
to be his enemy
and we admonish everyone who follows our prohibition not to follow him!

15- O God, bless Muhammad,
the Seal of the prophets and lord of the emissaries,
and the folk of his house,
the good, the pure!
Give refuge to us, our families, our brothers,
and all the faithful, male and female,
from that from which we seek refuge,
and grant us sanctuary from that through fear of which
we seek sanctuary in Thee!

16- Hear our supplication to Thee,
bestow upon us that of which we have been heedless,
and safeguard for us what we have forgotten!

and the degrees of the faithful!

revive Thy land

bring down prices in all the lands,
invigorate the beasts and the creatures,
perfect for us the agreeable things of provision,
make grow for us the fields,
let flow for us the teats,
and add for us strength to our strength!

6- O God,
make not the cloud's shadow over us a burning wind,
allow not its coldness to be cutting,
let not its pouring down upon us be a stoning,

O God, complete my intention through Thy gentleness, rectify my certainty through what is with Thee, and set right what is corrupt in me through Thy power!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, spare me the concerns which distract me, employ me in that about which Thou wilt ask me tomorrow, and let me pass my days in that for which Thou hast created me! Free me from need, expand Thy provision toward me, and tempt me not with ingratitude! Exalt me and afflict me not with pride! Make me worship Thee and corrupt not my worship with self-admiration! Let good flow out from my hands upon the people and efface it not by my making them feel obliged! Give me the highest moral traits and preserve me from vainglory! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, raise me not a single degree before the people without lowering me its like in myself and bring about no outward exaltation for me without an inward abasement in myself to the same measure!  
O God, bless Muhammad and Muhammad's Household, give me to enjoy a sound guidance which I seek not to replace, a path of truth from which I swerve not, and an intention of right conduct in which I have no doubts! Let me live as long as my life is a free gift in obeying Thee, but if my life should become a pasture for Satan, seize me to Thyself before Thy hatred overtakes me or Thy wrath against be becomes firm! O God, deposit in me no quality for which I will be faulted, unless Thou settest it right, no flaw for which I will be blamed, unless Thou makest it beautiful, no deficient noble trait, unless Thou completest it!  
O God, bless Muhammad and Muhammad's Household and replace for me the animosity of the people of hatred with love, the envy of the people of insolence with affection, the suspicion of the people of righteousness with trust, the enmity of those close with friendship, the disrespect of womb relatives with devotion, the abandonment of relatives with help, the attachment of flatterers with love set right, the rejection of fellows with generous friendliness, and the bitterness of the fear of wrongdoers with the sweetness of security!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, appoint for me a hand against him who wrongs me, a tongue against him who disputes with me, and a victory over him who stubbornly resists me! Give me guile against him who schemes against me, power over him who oppresses me, refutation of him who reviles me, and safety from him who threatens me! Grant me success to obey him who points me straight and follow him who guides me right! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and point me straight to resist him who is dishonest toward me with good counsel, repay him who separates from me with gentle devotion, reward him who deprives me with free giving, recompense him who cuts me off with joining, oppose him who slanders me with excellent mention, give thanks for good, and shut my eyes to evil!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, adorn me with the adornment of the righteous, and clothe me in the ornaments of the godfearing, through spreading justice, restraining rage, quenching the flame of hate, bringing together the people of separation, correcting discord, spreading about good behaviour, covering faults, mildness of temper, lowering the wing, beauty of conduct, gravity of bearing, agreeableness in comportment, precedence in reaching excellence, preferring bounteousness, refraining from condemnation, bestowing bounty on the undeserving, speaking the truth, though it be painful, making little of the good in my words and deeds, though it be much, and making much of the evil in my words and deeds, though it be little! Perfect this for me through lasting obedience, holding fast to the community, and rejecting the people of innovation and those who act in accordance with original opinions!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, appoint for me Thy widest provision in my old age and Thy strongest strength when I am exhausted, try me not with laziness in worship of Thee, blindness toward Thy path, undertaking what opposes love for Thee, joining with him who has separated himself from Thee, and separating from him who has joined himself to Thee! O God, make me leap to Thee in times of distress, ask from Thee in needs, and plead to Thee in misery! Tempt me not to seek help from other than Thee when I am distressed, to humble myself in asking from someone else when I am poor, or to plead with someone less than Thee when I fear, for then I would deserve Thy abandonment, Thy withholding, and Thy turning away, O Most Merciful of the merciful! O God, make the wishing, the doubt, and the envy which Satan throws into my heart a remembrance of Thy mightiness, a reflection upon Thy power, and a devising against Thy enemy! Make everything he causes to pass over my tongue, the indecent or ugly words, the maligning of good repute, the false witness, the speaking ill of an absent man of faith or the reviling of one present, and all things similar a speech in praise of Thee, a pursual of eulogizing Thee, an excursion in magnifying Thee, a thanksgiving for Thy favour, an acknowledgement of Thy beneficence, and an enumeration of Thy kindnesses!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, let me not be wronged while Thou canst repel from me, let me not do wrong while Thou art powerful over holding me back, let me not be misguided while Thou art able to guide me, let me not be poor while with Thee is my plenty, let me not be insolent while from Thee comes my wealth! O God, I come to Thy forgiveness, I go straight to Thy pardon, I yearn for Thy forbearance, and I trust in Thy bounty, but there is nothing with me to make me warrant Thy forgiveness, nothing in my works to make me merit Thy pardon, and nothing on my behalf after I judge my soul but Thy bounty, so bless Muhammad and his Household and bestow Thy bounty upon me! O God, make my speech be guidance, inspire me with reverential fear, give me success in that which is most pure, and employ me in what is most pleasing to Thee! O God, let me tread the most exemplary path and make me live and die in Thy creed!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, give me to enjoy moderation, make me into one of the people of right behaviour, the proofs of right conduct, and the servants of righteousness, and provide me with triumph at the place of Return and safety from the Ambush! O God, take to Thyself from my soul what will purify it and leave for my soul that of my soul that will set it right, for my soul will perish unless Thou preservest it! O God, Thou art my stores when I sorrow, Thou art my recourse when I am deprived, from Thee I seek aid when troubled and with Thee is a substitute for everything gone by, a correction for everything corrupted, and a change from everything Thou disapprovest. So show kindness to me with well-being before affliction, wealth before asking, right conduct before misguidance; suffice me against the burden of shame toward the servants, give me security on the Day of Return, and grant me excellent right guidance! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, repel from me through Thy gentleness, feed me through Thy favour, set me right through Thy generosity, heal me through Thy benefaction, shade me in Thy shelter, wrap me in Thy good pleasure, and give me success to reach the most guided of affairs when affairs confuse me, the purest of works when works seem similar, and the most pleasing to Thee of creeds when creeds conflict!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, crown me with sufficiency, place in me excellent guardianship, give me to guide correctly, tempt me not with plenty, grant me excellent ease, make not my life toil and trouble, and refuse not my supplication in rejection, for I make none rival to Thee and I supplicate none with Thee as equal! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, hold me back from prodigality, fortify my provision against ruin, increase my possessions through blessing them, and set me upon the path of guidance through piety in what I spend!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, spare me the burden of earning, and provide for me without reckoning, lest I be distracted from Thy worship through seeking and carry the load of earning's ill results! O God, bestow upon me what I seek through Thy power and grant me sanctuary from what I fear through Thy might! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, save my face through ease, and demean not my dignity through neediness, lest I seek provision from those whom Thou hast provided and asks for bestowal from the worst of Thy creatures! Then I would be tried by praising him who gave to me and afflicted with blaming him who held back from me, while Thou not they art patron of giving and holding back. O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and provide me with soundness in worship, detachment in renunciation, knowledge put into action, and abstinence in measure! O God, seal my term with Thy pardon, verify my expectation in hoping for Thy mercy, smooth my paths to reach Thy good pleasure, and make my works good in all my states!  
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, incite me to remember Thee in times of heedlessness, employ me in Thy obedience in days of disregard, open a smooth road for me to Thy love, and complete for me thereby the good of this world and the next!

21,In Sorrow,His Supplication when Something Made him Sorrow and Offenses Made him Worry,"1- O God,
O Sufficer of the isolated and weak
and Protector against terrifying affairs!
Offenses have isolated me,
so there is none to be my companion.
I am too weak for Thy wrath
and there is none to strengthen me.
I have approached the terror of meeting Thee
and there is none to still my fear.

2- Who can make me secure from Thee
when Thou hast filled me with terror?
Who can come to my aid
when Thou hast isolated me?
Who can strengthen me
when Thou hast weakened me?

3- None can grant sanctuary to a vassal, my God, but a lord,
none can give security to one dominated
but a dominator,
none can aid him from whom demands are made
but a demander.

4- In Thy hand, my God, is the thread of all that,
in Thee the place of escape and flight,
so bless Muhammad and his Household,
give sanctuary to me in my flight,
and grant my request!

5- O God, if Thou shouldst turn Thy generous face away from me,
withhold from me Thy immense bounty,
forbid me Thy provision,
or cut off from me Thy thread,
I will find no way to anything of my hope
other than Thee
nor be given power over what is with Thee
through another's aid,
for I am Thy servant and in Thy grasp;
my forelock is in Thy hand.1

6- I have no command along with Thy command.
Accomplished is Thy judgement of me,
just Thy decree for me!'2
I have not the strength to emerge from Thy authority
nor am I able to step outside Thy power.
I cannot win Thy inclination,
arrive at Thy good pleasure,
or attain what is with Thee
except through obeying Thee
and through the bounty of Thy mercy.

7- O God,
I rise in the morning and enter into evening
as Thy lowly slave.
I own no profit and loss for myself
except through Thee.
I witness to that over myself
and I confess to the frailty of my strength
and the paucity of my stratagems.
So accomplish what Thou hast promised me
and complete for me what Thou hast given me,
for I am Thy slave,
miserable, abased, frail, distressed, vile,
despised, poor, fearful,
and seeking sanctuary!

8- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and let me not forget to remember Thee in what Thou hast done for me,

or despair of Thy response to me,
though it keep me waiting,
whether I be in prosperity or adversity,
hardship or ease,
well-being or affliction,
misery or comfort,
wealth or distress,
poverty or riches!

9- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
make me laud Thee, extol Thee, and praise Thee in all my states

nor sorrow over that of it which Thou withholdest from me!
Impart reverential fear of Thee to my heart,
employ my body in that which Thou acceptest from me,
and divert my soul through obedience to Thee
from all that enters upon me,
so that I love nothing that displeases Thee
and become displeased at nothing that pleases Thee!

10- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
empty my heart for Thy love,
occupy it with remembering Thee,
animate it with fear of Thee and quaking before Thee,
strengthen it with beseeching Thee,
incline it to Thy obedience,
set it running in the path most beloved to Thee,
and subdue it through desire for what is with Thee
all the days of my life!

11- Let my provision in this world
be reverential fear of Thee,3
my journey be toward Thy mercy,
and my entrance
be into Thy good pleasure!
Appoint for me a lodging
in Thy Garden,
give me strength to bear
everything that pleases Thee,
make me flee to Thee
and desire what is with Thee,
clothe my heart in estrangement
from the evil among Thy creatures,
and give me intimacy with Thee,
Thy friends,
and those who obey Thee!

12- Assign to no wicked person or unbeliever
a kindness toward me
or a hand that obliges me,
nor to me a need for one of them!
Rather make
the stillness of my heart,
the comfort of my soul,
my independence and my sufficiency
lie in Thee and the best of Thy creatures!

13- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,

make me their helper,

with that which belongs more to Thee than to me.
Thy power over it and over me is greater than my power,
so give me in myself what will make Thee pleased with me
and take for Thyself Thy good pleasure in my self's well-being!

2- O God, I have no endurance for effort,
no patience in affliction,
no strength to bear poverty.
So forbid me not my provision
and entrust me not to Thy creatures,
but take care of my need alone
and Thyself attend to sufficing me!

3- Look upon me and look after me in all my affairs,
for if Thou entrustest me to myself,
I will be incapable before myself and fail to undertake that in which my best interest lies.
If Thou entrustest me to Thy creatures,
they will frown upon me,
and if Thou makest me resort to my kinsfolk,
they will refuse to give to me;
if they give, they will give little and in bad temper,
making me feel long obliged
and blaming me much.

4- So through Thy bounty, O God, free me from need,
through Thy mightiness, lift me up,
through Thy boundless plenty, open my hand,
and with that which is with Thee, suffice me!

covered, defended,
given refuge, and granted sanctuary!

bless Muhammad and his Household

Thou hast enjoined upon me

my strength too feeble,
my power not able to reach it,
and my possessions and what my hand owns
not encompass it,
and whether I have remembered it or forgotten it.

7- It, my Lord, is among that which Thou hast counted against me
while I have been heedless of it in myself.
Let me perform it
through Thy plentiful giving
and the abundance which is with Thee

so that nothing of it may remain against me,

to settle accounts for it from my good deeds
or to compound my evil deeds
on the day I meet Thee, my Lord!

in this world and the next,
so be ever gracious toward my needs!

11- O God, bless Muhammad and Muhammad's Household

for that through which Thou hast favoured me
in ease and difficulty,
health and sickness,
such that I may come to know in myself
repose in satisfaction
and serenity of soul
in that which Thou hast made incumbent upon me
in whatever states may occur: fear and security,
satisfaction and displeasure,
loss and gain!

12- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and provide me with a breast safe from envy,
such that I envy none of Thy creatures
and in anything of Thy bounty
and such that I see none of Thy favours
toward any of Thy creatures
in religion or this world, well-being or reverential fear, plenty or ease,
without hoping for myself better than it
through and from Thee alone,
who hast no associate!

13- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household
and provide me in this world and the next
with caution against offenses
and wariness against slips
in the state of satisfaction and wrath,
such that I may
remain indifferent toward that which enters upon me
from the two states,2
work toward Thy obedience,
and prefer it and Thy good pleasure over all else
in both friends and enemies.
Then my enemy may stay secure
from my wrongdoing and injustice

the evil of everyone, jinn or man, who declares war on Thy Messenger and his Household,

and the evil of every crawling creature
that Thou hast taken by the forelock!
Surely Thou art on a straight path.3

7- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household
and if someone desires ill for me
turn him away from me,
drive away from me his deception,
avert from me his evil, send his trickery back to his own throat,

8- and place before him a barricade,
so that Thou mayest blind his eyes toward me,
deafen his ears toward my mention,
lock his heart toward recalling me,
silence his tongue against me,
restrain his head, abase his exaltation,
break his arrogance, abase his neck, disjoint his pride,

and make me secure from all his injury,
his evil, his slander,
his backbiting, his faultfinding,
his envy, his enmity,
his snares, his traps,
his foot soldiers, and his cavalry!

24,For his Parents ,His Supplication for his Parents (upon the two of them be peace) ,"1- O God, bless Muhammad, Thy slave and Thy messenger,
and his Household, the pure,
and single them out for the best of Thy blessings, Thy mercy,
Thy benedictions, and Thy peace!

2- And single out my parents, O God,
for honour with Thee and blessings from Thee,
O Most Merciful of the merciful!

3- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
teach me through inspiration knowledge of everything incumbent upon me toward them,
and gather within me
knowledge of all that completely!
Then make me act in accordance
with what Thou hast inspired me
and give me the success to put into practice
the knowledge Thou hast shown to me,
lest I fail to act
according to something Thou hast taught me
or my limbs feel too heavy to perform
that with which Thou hast inspired me!

4- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
as Thou hast ennobled us through him,
and bless Muhammad and his Household,
as Thou hast made incumbent upon us
rights toward the creatures because of him!1

5- O God,
fill me with awe of my parents,
the awe one has toward a tyrannical sovereign,
and let me be devoted to them,
with the devotion of a compassionate mother!
Make my obedience and devotion to them
more gladdening to my eyes than sleep to the drowsy
and more refreshing to my breast than drink to the thirsty,
so that I may prefer their inclination to my inclination,
set their satisfaction before my satisfaction,
make much of their devotion to me though it be little,
and make little of my devotion to them though it be great.

6- God, lower before them my voice,
make agreeable to them my words,
make mild before them my temper,
make tender toward them my heart,
and turn me into their kind companion,
their loving friend!

7- O God,
thank them for my upbringing,
reward them for honouring me,
and guard them as they guarded me in my infancy!

8- O God, and whatever harm has touched them from me,
detested thing has reached them from me,
or right of theirs which has been neglected by me,
allow it to alleviate their sins,
raise them in their degrees,
and add to their good deeds!
O He who changes evil deeds into manifold good deeds!2

9- O God, whatever word through which they have transgressed against me,
act through which they have been immoderate with me,
right of mine which they have left neglected,
or obligation toward me in which they have fallen short,
I grant it to them and bestow it upon them,
and I beseech Thee
to remove from them its ill consequence,
for I do not accuse them concerning myself,
find them slow in their devotion toward me,
or dislike the way they have attended to my affairs, my Lord!

10- They have rights against me which are more incumbent,
precedence in beneficence toward me that is greater,
and kindness toward me that is mightier
than that I should settle accounts with justice
or repay them with equivalents.
Where then, my God, would be their long occupation
with bringing me up?
Where the hardship of their toil
in taking care of me?
Where the stinting of themselves
to provide me with plenty?

11- What an idea!
I can never discharge their right against me,
fulfil my obligations toward them,
or accomplish the duty of serving them.
So bless Muhammad and his Household
and help me, O Best of those whose help we seek!
Give me success, O Most Guiding of those whom we beseech!
Place me not among the people of disrespect to fathers and mothers
on the day when every soul will be repaid
for what it has earned,
they shall not be wronged.3

12- O God,
bless Muhammad, his Household, and his progeny
and single out my parents for the best
which Thou hast singled out for the fathers and mothers of Thy faithful servants,
O Most Merciful of the merciful!

13- O God,
let me not forget to remember them after my ritual prayers,
at every time throughout my night,
and in each of the hours of my day!

14- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
forgive me through my supplication for my parents,
forgive them through their devotion toward me
with unfailing forgiveness,
be well pleased with them through my intercession for them
with resolute good pleasure,
and make them reach through Thy generosity
the abodes of safety!

15- O God,
if Thy forgiveness reaches them first,
make them my intercessors,
and if Thy forgiveness reaches me first,
make me their intercessors,
so that we may gather together through Thy gentleness
in the house of Thy generosity
and the place of Thy forgiveness and mercy!

25,For his Children,His Supplication for his Children,"1- O God, be kind to me through
the survival of my children, setting them right for me,
and allowing me to enjoy them!

increase their terms,
bring up the smallest for me,
strengthen the weakest for me,
rectify for me
their bodies, their religious dedication,
and their moral traits,
make them well in their souls, their limbs,
and everything that concerns me of their affair,
and pour out for me and upon my hand
their provisions!

3- Make them pious, fearing,
insightful, hearing, and obedient
toward Thee,
loving and well-disposed toward Thy friends,
and stubbornly resistant and full of hate
toward all Thy enemies!
Amen!

4- O God,
through them
strengthen my arm,
straighten my burdened back,
multiply my number,
adorn my presence,
keep alive my mention,
suffice me when I am away,
help me in my needs,
and make them
loving toward me,
affectionate, approaching, upright,
obedient, never disobedient, disrespectful,
opposed, or offenders!

5- Help me in their upbringing,
their education, and my devotion toward them,
give me among them from Thyself male children,
make that a good for me,
and make them a help for me
in that which I ask from Thee!

6- Give me and my progeny refuge from the accursed Satan,
for Thou hast created us, commanded us, and prohibited us,
and made us desire the reward of what Thou hast commanded, and fear its punishment!
Thou assigned to us an enemy who schemes against us,
gave him an authority over us in a way that Thou didst not give us authority over him,
allowed him to dwell in our breasts
and let him run in our blood vessels;
he is not heedless, though we be heedless,
he does not forget, though we forget;
he makes us feel secure from Thy punishment
and fills us with fear toward other than Thee.

7- If we are about to commit an indecency,
he gives us courage to do so,
and if we are about to perform a righteous work,
he holds us back from it.
He opposes us through passions,1
and sets up for us doubts.
If he promises us, he lies,
and if he raises our hopes, he fails to fulfil them.
If Thou dost not turn his trickery away from us,
he will misguide us,
and if Thou dost not protect us from his corruption, he will cause us to slip.

8- O God,
so defeat his authority over us through Thy authority,
such that Thou holdest him back from us
through the frequency of our supplication to Thee
and we leave his trickery and rise up among those preserved by Thee from sin!

9- O God, grant me my every request,
accomplish for me my needs,
withhold not from me Thy response
when Thou hast made Thyself accountable for it to me,2
veil not my supplication from Thyself, when Thou hast commanded me to make it,3
and be kind to me through everything that will set me right in this world and the next,
in everything that I remember or forget,
display or conceal,
make public or keep secret!

10- In all of this, place me through my asking Thee among those who set things right,
those who are answered favourably when they request from Thee
and from whom is not withheld
when they put their trust in Thee,

11- those accustomed to seek refuge in Thee,
those who profit through commerce with Thee,
those granted sanctuary
through Thy might,
those given lawful provision in plenty from Thy boundless bounty
through Thy munificence and generosity,
those who reach exaltation after abasement
through Thee,
those granted sanctuary from wrong
through Thy justice,
those released from affliction through Thy mercy,
those delivered from need after poverty through Thy riches,
those preserved from sins, slips, and offenses
through reverential fear toward Thee,
those successful in goodness, right conduct, and propriety through obeying Thee,
those walled off from sins through Thy power,
the refrainers from every act of disobedience toward Thee,
the dwellers in Thy neighbourhood!

12- O God, give me all of that through Thy bestowal of success and Thy mercy,
grant us refuge from the chastisement of the burning,
and give to
all the Muslims, male and female,
and all the faithful, male and female,
the like of what I have asked for myself and my children,
in the immediate of this world
and the deferred of the next!

helping their wronged,

3- Let me, O God, repay their evildoer
with good-doing,
turn away from their wrongdoer with forbearance.

attend to all of them with devotion,
lower my eyes before them in continence,
make mild my side toward them

love that they continue to receive favour

27,For the People of the Frontiers,His Supplication for the People of the Frontiers (Ahl- Thughoor),"1- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
fortify the frontiers of the Muslims through Thy might,
support their defenders through Thy strength,
and lavish upon them gifts through Thy wealth!

2- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
increase their number, hone their weapons, guard their territory,
defend their midst, unite their throng,
arrange their affair,
send them supplies in a steady string,
undertake Thyself to suffice them with provisions,
support them with victory, help them with patience,
and give them subtlety in guile!1

3- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
give them the knowledge of that of which they are ignorant,
teach them what they do not know,
and show them what they do not see!

4- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
make them forget when they meet the enemy
to remember this cheating and delusive world of theirs,
erase from their hearts the thought of enchanting possessions,
place the Garden before their eyes,
and display to their sight that part of it
which Thou hast prepared for them
- the homes of everlastingness and mansions of honour,
the beautiful houris,
the rivers gushing forth with all sorts of drinks,
the trees hanging, low with all kinds of fruits -
lest any of them think of turning his back
or suggest to himself to flee his opponent!

5- O God, defeat their enemy through that,
trim their nails from them,
separate them from their weapons,
pull out the firm ties from their hearts,
keep them far away from their stores,
bewilder them in their roads, turn them astray from their direction,
cut off reinforcements from them, chop them down in numbers,
fill their hearts with terror,
hold back their hands from stretching forth,
tie back their tongues from speaking,
scatter by them the ones behind them2
make them a lesson for those beyond them,
and through their degradation
cut off the hopes of those who come after them!

6- O God,
make the wombs of their women barren,
dry up the loins of their men,
cut off the breeding of their mounts and their cattle,
and permit not their sky to rain or their earth to grow!

7- O God, through that
strengthen the prowess3 of the People of Islam,
fortify their cities,
increase their properties,
give them ease from their fighting to worship Thee
and from their warfare to be alone with Thee,
so that none will be worshipped in the regions of the earth but Thee
and no forehead of theirs may be rubbed in dust
for less than Thee!

8- O God, send out the Muslims of every region on raids
against the idolaters who face them!
Reinforce them with angels in ranks from Thee,
till the idolaters are routed by them to the end of the land,
slain in Thy earth or taken captive,
or till they admit that Thou art God,
other than whom there is no god, Thou alone, who hast no associate!

9- O God, include in this Thy enemies in the regions of the lands,
the Indians, the Byzantines, the Turks,
the Khazars, the Abyssinians, the Nubians,
the Zanjis, the Slavs, the Daylamites, and the rest of the idol-worshipping nations,
those whose names and attributes are concealed,
but whom Thou countest in Thy cognizance
and overseest through Thy power!

10- O God, distract the idolaters from reaching for the borders of the Muslims through the idolaters,
bar them from cutting them down
through being cut down,
and hold them back from massing together against them through dissension!

11- O God, empty their hearts of security
and their bodies of strength,
distract their hearts from thinking of stratagems,
make their limbs too feeble for clashing with men,
make them too cowardly for contending with champions,
send against them a troop of Thy angels with some of Thy severity
as Thou didst on the Day of Badr,4
so that through it Thou mayest cut off their roots, harvest their thorns,
and disperse their number!

12- O God, mix their waters with pestilence
and their foods with maladies,
hurl down their cities, harass them with peltings,
hinder them through drought,
place their supplies in the most ill-omened part of Thy earth
and the farthest from them,
bar them from its fortresses,
and strike them with constant hunger and painful illness!

13- O God, if a warrior from the people of Thy creed wars against them
or a struggler from the followers of Thy prescriptions
struggles against them
so that Thy religion may be the highest,
Thy party the strongest, and Thy share the fullest,
cast ease to him, arrange his affair,
attend to him by granting success,
select for him his companions, strengthen his back,
lavish upon him livelihood,
give him enjoyment of joyous vitality,
cool for him the heat of yearning,
give him sanctuary from the gloom of loneliness,
make him forget the remembrance of wife and child,

14- pass along to him an excellent intention,
attend to him with well-being,
make safety his companion, release him from cowardice,
inspire him with boldness,
provide him with strength,
support him with help,
teach him right conduct and the norms of the Sunna,
point him straight in judgement,
remove from him hypocrisy, purify him from seeking fame,
and make his thinking and remembrance,
his departing and his staying,
be in Thee and for Thee!

15- When he stands in ranks before Thy enemy and his enemy,
make them few in his eye,
diminish their importance in his heart,
give him a turn to prevail over them, not them a turn to prevail over him!
But if Thou sealest him with felicity
and decreest for him martyrdom,
then let it be after
he has exterminated Thy enemies by slaying,
captivity has afflicted them,
the borders of the Muslims are secure,
and Thy enemy has turned his back in flight!

16- O God,
and if a Muslim should
take the place of a warrior or a soldier in his home,
or attend to those left behind in his absence,
or help him with a portion of his property,
assist him with equipment, hone him for the struggle,
send along with him a supplication for his purpose,
or guard his honour in his absence,
reward him with the like of his reward
measure for measure, like for like,
and recompense him for his act with an immediate compensation
through which he will hasten to
the profit of what he has sent forth
and the joy of what he has given,
till the present moment takes him to
the bounty Thou hast granted to him
and the generosity Thou hast prepared for him!

17- O God,
and if the affair of Islam should worry a Muslim
and the alliance of the idolaters' against Islam
should grieve him,
so that he has the intention to go to war
and is about to enter the struggle,
but frailty keeps him seated,
neediness keeps him waiting,
a mishap delays him,
or an obstruction prevents him from his wish,
write his name among the worshipers,
make incumbent for him the reward of the strugglers,
and place him among the ranks
of the martyrs and the righteous!

18- O God, bless Muhammad, Thy slave and Thy messenger,
and the Household of Muhammad,
with a blessing high above all other blessings,
towering beyond all other salutations,
a blessing whose end is never reached
and whose number is never cut off,
like the most perfect of Thy blessings that has passed

28,In Fleeing to God,His Supplication in Fleeing to God,"1- O God, I showed sincerity by cutting myself off from everything but Thee.

2- I approached Thee with my whole self.

3- I averted my face from everyone who needs Thy support.

4- I ceased to ask from any who cannot do without Thy bounty.

5- I saw that the needy who seeks from the needy
is foolish in his opinion, and misguided in his intellect.

6- How many people have I seen, my God,
who sought exaltation through other than Thee
and were abased,
who wanted wealth from someone else
and became poor,
who tried to rise high and fell down low!

7- Observing the likes of them corrects a prudent man;
his taking heed gives him success;
his choosing the best guides him to the path of right.

8- So Thou, my Master,
art the object of my asking to the exclusion of all those who are asked
and the patron of my need to the exclusion of all those from whom requests are made.

9- Thou art singled out for my call before all who are called;
none is associated with Thee in my hope,
none comes along with Thee in my supplication,
nor does any join with Thee within it,
for to Thee is my appeal.

10- To Thee, my God, belongs
the Unity of number,
the property of eternal power,
the excellence of force and strength,
the degree of sublimity and elevation.

11- Everyone other than Thee is the object of compassion in his lifetime,
overcome in his affair,
overwhelmed in his situation,
diverse in states,
constantly changing in attributes.

distrust in our provisions

the life-spans of the long-lived!

2- So bless Muhammad and his Household,
give us a true certainty

and inspire us with a sincere trust
that will release us from the hardship of exertion!

3- Let Thy clear promise in Thy Revelation
which Thou hast followed in Thy Book with Thy oath
cut off our worry about the provision
for which Thou hast made Thyself responsible
and sever our occupation with everything
whose sufficiency Thou hast guaranteed!

- and Thy word is the most truthful truth -
and Thou hast sworn

30,For Help in Repaying Debts,His Supplication for Help in Repaying Debts,"1- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and release me from a debt
which makes me lose face,
confuses my mind,
disrupts my thinking,
and prolongs my occupation with attending to it!

2- I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord,
from worry and thought about debt,
from the distraction and sleeplessness of debt;
so bless Muhammad and his Household and give me refuge from it!
I seek sanctuary in Thee, my Lord, from
debt's abasement in life
and its ill effects after death,
so bless Muhammad and his Household
and give me sanctuary from it through
a bountiful plenty
or a continually arriving sufficiency!

3- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household
prevent me from extravagance and excess,
put me on the course of generous spending and moderation,
teach me excellent distribution,
hold me back through Thy gentleness from squandering,
allow me to attain my provisions through lawful means,
direct my spending toward the gateways of devotion,
and take away from me any possession
which will bring forth pride in me,
lead to insolence,
or drag me in its heels to rebellion!

make me love the companionship of the poor
and help me be their companion with excellent patience!

the goods of this perishing world,
store them for me in Thy abiding treasuries!

31,In Repentance (Tauba),His Supplication in Repentance,"O God, O He whom the depiction of the describers fails to describe! O He beyond whom passes not the hope of the hopers! O He with whom is not lost the wage of the good-doers! O He who is the ultimate object of the fear of the worshipers! O He who is the utmost limit of the dread of the godfearing! This is the station of him whom sins have passed from hand to hand. Offenses' reins have led him on, and Satan has gained mastery over him. He fell short of what Thou hast commanded through neglect and he pursued what Thou hast prohibited in delusion, like one ignorant of Thy power over him or one who denies the bounty of Thy beneficence toward him, until, when the eye of guidance was opened for him and the clouds of blindness were dispelled, he reckoned that through which he had wronged himself and reflected upon that in which he had opposed his Lord. He saw his vast disobedience as vast and his great opposition as great.
So turned to Thee, hoping in Thee and ashamed before Thee, and he directed his beseeching toward Thee, having trust in Thee. He repaired to Thee in his longing with certitude and he went straight to Thee in fear with sincerity. His longing was devoid of every object of longing but Thee, and his fright departed from every object of fear but Thee. So he stood before Thee pleading, his eyes turned toward the ground in humbleness, his head bowed before Thy might in lowliness; he revealed to Thee in meekness those secrets of his which Thou knowest better than he; he numbered for Thee in humility those sins of his which Thou countest better than he; he sought help from Thee before the dreadful into which he has fallen in Thy knowledge and the ugly which has disgraced him in Thy judgement: the sins whose pleasures have turned their backs and gone and whose evil consequences have stayed and stuck fast.
He will not deny Thy justice, my God, if Thou punishest him, nor will he consider Thy pardon great if Thou pardonest him and hast mercy upon him, for Thou art the Generous Lord for whom the forgiveness of great sins is nothing great! O God, so here I am: I have come to Thee obeying Thy command (for Thou hast commanded supplication) and asking the fulfilment of Thy promise, (for Thou hast promised to respond) Thou hast said, Supplicate Me and I will respond to you. O God, so bless Muhammad and his Household, meet me with Thy forgiveness just as I have met Thee with my confession, lift me up from the fatal infirmities of sins just as I have let myself down before Thee, and cover me with Thy covering just as Thou hast shown no haste to take vengeance on me! O God, make firm my intention to obey Thee, strengthen my insight in worshipping Thee, give me the success of works which will wash away the defilement of offenses, and take me when Thou takest me in Thy creed and the creed of Thy prophet Muhammad (upon him be peace).
O God, I repent to Thee in this my station from my sins, great and small, my evil deeds, inward and outward, my lapses, past and recent, with the repentance of one who does not tell himself that he might disobey or secretly think that he might return to an offense. Thou hast said, my God, in the firm text of Thy Book, that Thou acceptest repentance from Thy servants, pardonest evil deeds, and lovest the repenters, so accept my repentance as Thou hast promised, pardon my evil deeds as thou hast guaranteed, and make obligatory toward me Thy love as Thou hast stipulated! To Thee, my Lord, belongs my stipulation that I will not return to what is disliked by Thee, my guarantee that I will not go back to what Thou blamest, and my covenant that I will stay away from acts of disobedience to Thee. O God, Thou knowest better what I have done, so forgive me what Thou knowest and turn me through Thy power to what Thou lovest! O God, counted against me are claims that stay in my memory and claims that I have forgotten, while all of them remain in Thy eye that does not sleep and Thy knowledge that does not forget! So compensate their owners, lighten their load upon me, lift up their weight from me, and preserve me from approaching their like! O God, but I can not be faithful to my repentance without Thy preservation, nor can I refrain from offenses without Thy strength.
So strengthen me with a sufficient strength and attend to me with a defending preservation! O God, if any servant repents to Thee, while in Thy knowledge of the Unseen he will break his repentance and return to his sin and offense, I seek refuge in Thee lest I be like that! So make this my repentance a repentance after which I will need no repentance and a repentance which will obligate the erasing of what has gone by and safety in what remains! O God, I ask pardon from Thee for my ignorance, and I ask Thee to disregard my evil acts! So join me to the shelter of Thy mercy through graciousness and cover me with the covering of Thy well-being through bounteousness! O God, I repent to Thee from everything opposed to Thy will or far from Thy love the thoughts of my heart, the glances of my eye, the tales of my tongue with a repentance through which each bodily part will by itself stay safe from ill consequences with Thee and remain secure from Thy painful penalties feared by transgressors! O God,so have mercy on my being alone before Thee, the pounding of my heart in dread of Thee, the trembling of my limbs in awe of Thee! My sins, my God, have stood me in the station of degradation in Thy courtyard. If I remain silent, none will speak for me; if I seek an intercessor, I am not worthy for intercession.
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, make Thy generosity intercede for my offenses, follow up my evil deeds with Thy pardon, repay me not with the punishment that is my proper repayment, spread over me Thy graciousness, wrap me in Thy covering, and do with me what is done by a mighty man, when a lowly slave pleads to him and he shows him mercy, or a rich man, when a poor slave submits himself and he raises him to wealth! O God,I have no protector against Thee, so let Thy might be my protector! I have no intercessor with Thee, so let Thy bounty be my intercessor! My offenses have set me quaking, so let Thy pardon give me security! Not all that I have said rises up from my ignorance of my evil footsteps or forgetfulness of my blameworthy acts in the past, but in order that Thy heaven and those within it and Thy earth and those upon it may hear the remorse which I have professed to Thee and the repentance through which I have sought asylum with Thee.
Then perhaps one of them, through Thy mercy, may show mercy upon my evil situation or be seized by tenderness for my evil state. There may come from him for my sake a supplication to which Thou givest ear more than to my supplication or an intercession surer with Thee than my intercession through which I may be delivered from Thy wrath and attain to Thy good pleasure! O God, if remorse is a repentance toward Thee, then I am the most remorseful of the remorseful! If refraining from disobedience is a turning back to Thee, then I am the first of those who turn back! If praying for forgiveness alleviates sins, surely I am one of those who pray for Thy forgiveness!
O God, as Thou hast commanded repentance and guaranteed acceptance, as Thou hast urged supplication, and promised to respond, so also bless Muhammad and his Household, accept my repentance, and return me not to the returning place of disappointment in Thy mercy! Surely Thou art Ever-turning toward the sinners, All-compassionate toward the offenders who turn back! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household just as Thou hast guided us by him! Bless Muhammad and his Household just as Thou hast rescued us through him! Bless Muhammad and his Household, with a blessing that will intercede for us on the Day of Resurrection, the day of neediness toward Thee! Thou art powerful over everything, and that is easy for Thee!",(Supplication - 31),sajjadiyya_31.mp3,1,31,دعاۓ توبہ,دعا در توبه و بازگشت,31-  دُعَاؤُهُ بِالتَّوْبَةِ.,दुआए तौबा,Repentir,R,,1.0,56.0,,
32,In the Night Prayer,His Supplication for himself in Confessing Sins after Finishing the Night Prayer,"1- O God, O Possessor of kingdom perpetual in everlastingness,

2- authority invincible without armies or helpers,

3- might abiding through aeons past, years gone by, times and days elapsed!

4- Thy authority is mighty with a might that knows no bound by being first
nor utmost end by being last!

5- Thy kingdom towers high with a towering
before which all things fall down without reaching its term;

6- the least of it which Thou hast kept to Thyself is not reached
by the furthest description of the describers!

7- Attributes go astray in Thee,
descriptions fall apart below Thee,
the subtlest of imaginations are bewildered
by Thy magnificence!

8- So art Thou:
God, the First in Thy firstness,
and so art Thou everlastingly.
Thou dost not pass away.

9- But I am the slave, feeble in works,
immense in hopes.
The tying links are outside my hand,
except what is tied by Thy mercy;
the bonds of hopes have been cut away from me,
except the pardon to which I hold fast.

10- Little on my part is the obedience toward Thee upon which I count,
and great against me the disobedience toward Thee to which I have reverted.
But pardoning Thy slave will not constrain Thee, even if he be bad,
so pardon me!

11- O God, Thy knowledge watches over hidden works,
every covered thing is exposed before Thy awareness,
the intricacies of things are not concealed from Thee,
and unseen mysteries slip not away from Thee.

12- But over me Thy enemy has gained mastery:
He asked a delay from Thee to lead me astray,
and Thou gavest him the delay!
He asked a respite from Thee until the Day of Doom to misguide me,
and Thou gavest him the respite!1

13- So he threw me down, though I had fled to Thee from
small, ruinous sins
and great, deadly works,
until, when I had yielded to disobeying Thee
and merited Thy anger through my bad efforts,
he turned the bridle of his treachery away from me,
met me with the word of his ingratitude,
undertook to be quit of me,2
turned his back to flee from me,
threw me to the desert of Thy wrath alone,
and sent me as an outcast
into the courtyard of Thy vengeance.

14- There is no intercessor to intercede for me with Thee,
no protector to make me feel secure against Thee,
no fortress to veil me from Thee,
no shelter in which to seek asylum apart from Thee!

15- This is the station of him who takes refuge with Thee,
the place of the confessor to Thee:
Let not Thy bounty be too narrow for me,
let not Thy pardon fall short of me!
Let me not be the most disappointed
of Thy repentant servants,
nor the most despairing
of those who come to Thee with expectations!
Forgive me,
surely Thou art the best of the forgivers!

16- O God,
Thou commanded me, and I refrained,
Thou prohibited me, and I committed.
evil thoughts tempted me to offend,
and I was negligent.

17- I cannot call upon daytime to witness my fasting,
nor can I seek sanctuary in night because of my vigil;
no Sunna praises me for keeping it alive,
only Thy obligations,
he who neglects which has perished.

18- I cannot seek access to Thee through the excellence of a supererogatory work,
given the many duties of Thy obligations
of which I have been heedless
and the stations of Thy bounds which I have transgressed,
thereby violating sacred things and committing great sins,
though Thou hast given me safety from their disgraces as a covering.

19- This is the station of him who is
ashamed of himself before Thee,
angry with himself, and satisfied with Thee.
He meets Thee with a humble soul,
a neck bent down, a back heavy with offenses,
hesitating between longing for Thee and fear of Thee.

20- Thou art the most worthy of those in whom he might hope,
the most deserving for him to dread and fear.
So give me, my Lord, what I hope for,
make me secure against what frightens me, and act kindly toward me with the kindly act of mercy!
Surely Thou art the most generous
of those from whom are asked!

21- O God, since Thou hast covered me with Thy pardon
and shielded me with Thy bounty
in the abode of annihilation and the presence of equals,
grant me sanctuary from the disgraces of the Abode of Subsistence
at the standing places of the Witnesses
(the angels brought nigh,
the messengers honoured,
the martyrs, the righteous)
before the neighbour from whom I have hidden my evil deeds
and the womb relative before whom I feel ashamed in my secret thoughts!

22- I trust them not, my Lord, to cover me over,
but I trust Thee, my Lord, to forgive me!
Thou art the most worthy of those in whom confidence is had,
the most giving of those who are besought,
and the most clement of those from whom mercy is asked.
So have mercy upon me!

23- O God, Thou caused me to descend as mean water
from loins of narrow bones and tight passages
into a constricted womb which Thou hadst covered with veils;3
Thou turned me about from state to state
until Thou tookest me to the completion of the form
and fixed within me the bodily parts,
as Thou hast described in Thy Book:
a drop, then a clot,
then a tissue, then bones,
then Thou garmented the bones with flesh,
then Thou produced me as another creature
as Thou willed.4

24- Then, when I needed Thy provision,
and could not do without the aid of Thy bounty,
Thou appointed for me a nourishment
from the bounty of the food and drink
which Thou bestowed upon Thy handmaid
in whose belly Thou gavest me to rest
and in the lodging of whose womb
Thou deposited me.

25- Hadst Thou entrusted me in those states, my Lord, to my own force
or driven me to have recourse to my own strength,
force would have been removed from me
and strength taken far away.

26. So Thou hast fed me through Thy bounty
with the food of the Good, the Gentle;
Thou hast done that for me in graciousness toward me
up to this my present point.
I do not lack Thy goodness,
nor does Thy benefaction keep me waiting.
Yet with all that,
my trust has not become firm enough
that I might free myself
for that which is more favoured by Thee.

27- Satan has taken possession of my reins
through my distrust and frail certainty.
I complain of his evil neighbourhood with me
and my soul's obedience toward him!
I ask Thee to preserve me against his domination,
and I plead with Thee to turn his trickery away from me!

28- I ask Thee
to make the path to my provision easy,
since to Thee belongs praise for
Thy beginning with immense favours
and Thy inspiring gratitude
for beneficence and bestowing favour!
Bless Muhammad and his Household,
and make the way to my provision easy for me!
[I ask Thee] to make me content
with Thy ordainment for me,
to make me satisfied with my lot
in that which Thou hast apportioned for me
and to place what has gone of my body and my life-span
into the path of Thy obedience!5
Surely Thou art the Best of providers!

29- O God, I seek refuge in Thee from the Fire
through which Thou art harsh toward him who disobeys Thee
and by which Thou hast threatened him who turns away from Thy good pleasure;
from the Fire
whose light is darkness, whose ease is pain,
and whose far is near;
from the Fire
parts of which devour parts
and parts of which leap upon parts;

30- from the Fire which
leaves bones decayed
and lets its people drink boiling water;
from the Fire which
'does not spare him who pleads to it,'6
has no mercy on him who seeks sympathy from it,
and has no power to relieve him who humbles himself before it
and yields himself to it;
it meets its inhabitants with the hottest that it possesses:
painful punishment and intense noxiousness.

31- I seek refuge in Thee from its gaping-jawed scorpions,
its scraping-toothed serpents,
and its drinks, which tear apart the intestines and hearts of its inhabitants
and root out their marrows.
I ask guidance from Thee to that which will keep far from it and make it retreat!

32- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
grant me sanctuary from it through the bounty of Thy mercy,
release me from my stumbles through Thy good releasing,
and abandon me not,
O Best of the sanctuary-granters!

33- O God, Thou protectest from the disliked,
givest the good,
dost what Thou wilt,
and Thou art powerful over everything.7

34- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
when the pious are mentioned
and bless Muhammad and his Household as long as night and day come and go
with a blessing whose replenishment is never cut off
and whose number cannot be counted,
a blessing that will fill up the air

Inspire us to yield to that which Thou bringest upon us by Thy will, lest we love the delay of what Thou hast hastened and the hastening of what Thou hast delayed, dislike what Thou lovest, and choose what Thou dislikest!

34,When Afflicted,His Supplication when he was Afflicted or saw Someone Afflicted with the Disgrace of Sin,"1- O God, to Thee belongs praise for Thy covering over after Thy knowledge
and Thy pardon after Thy awareness!
Each of us has committed faults, but Thou hast not made him notorious,
done indecencies, but Thou hast not disgraced him,
and covered over evil deeds, but Thou hast not pointed to him.

2- How many are Thy prohibited acts which we have performed,
Thy commandments of which Thou hast told us
which we have transgressed,
the evil deeds which we have earned,
the offenses which we have committed!
Thou seest them to the exclusion of all observers;
Thou hast the power to make them public above all the powerful!
By giving us safety Thou hast veiled their eyes
and stoppled their ears.

3- So make the shameful things Thou hast covered over
and the inward reality Thou hast concealed
our admonisher,
a restrainer upon bad character traits and committing offenses,
and a striving toward the repentance that erases [sins]
and the praiseworthy path!

4- Bring the time of striving near
and visit us not with heedlessness of Thee!
Surely we are Thy beseechers,
the repenters of sins.

5- And bless Thy chosen, O God, from Thy creation,
Muhammad and his descendants,
the friends selected from among Thy creatures, the pure,

35,In Satisfaction with the Decree,His Supplication in Satisfaction when he Looked upon the Companions of this World,"1- Praise belongs to God in satisfaction with God's decision!
I bear witness that God has apportioned the livelihoods of His servants with justice
and undertaken bounty for all His creatures.

2- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
tempt me not with what Thou hast given to Thy creatures
and tempt them not with what Thou hast withheld from me.
Lest I envy Thy creatures
and despise Thy decision!

3- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
delight my soul through Thy decree,
expand my breast through the instances of Thy decision,
give to me a trust through which I may admit
that Thy decree runs only to the best,
and let my gratitude to Thee for what Thou hast taken away from me
be more abundant than my gratitude to Thee
for what Thou hast conferred upon me!

4- Preserve me from imagining any meanness
in someone who is destitute
or imagining any superiority in someone who possesses wealth,
for the noble is he whom obedience to Thee has ennobled
and the exalted is he whom worship of Thee has exalted!

5. So bless Muhammad and his Household,
give us to enjoy a wealth
which does not run out,
confirm us with an exaltation which will never be lost,
and let us roam freely
in the kingdom of everlastingness!

36,Upon Hearing Thunder,His Supplication when he Looked upon Clouds and Lightening and Heard the Sound of Thunder,"1- O God, these are two of Thy signs
and these are two of Thy helpers.
They rush to obey Thee
with beneficial mercy
or injurious vengeance,
so rain not down upon us from them
the evil rain1
and clothe us not through them
in the garment of affliction!

2- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
send down upon us the benefit of these clouds
and their blessing,
turn away from us their harm and their injury,
strike us not through them with blight,
and loose not upon our livelihoods any bane!

3- O God,
if Thou hast incited them as vengeance
and loosed them in anger,
we seek sanctuary with Thee from Thy wrath
and implore Thee in asking Thy pardon!
So incline with wrath toward the idolaters
and set the millstone of Thy vengeance
turning upon the heretics!2

4- O God,
take away the barrenness of our lands
with Thy watering,
dislodge the malice from our breasts
with Thy providing,
distract us not from Thee through other than Thee,
and cut none of us off
from the stuff of Thy goodness,
for the rich is he to whom Thou hast given riches,
and the safe he whom Thou hast protected!

5- No one has any defense against Thee,
nor any means to bar Thy penalty.
Thou decidest what Thou wilt for whom Thou wilt
and Thou decreest what Thou desirest
for any whom Thou desirest!

6- So to Thee belongs praise for protecting us from affliction
and to Thee belongs thanks for conferring upon us blessings,
a praise which will leave behind the praise of the praisers,
a praise which will fill the earth and the heaven!

7- Surely Thou art the All-kind through immense kindnesses,
the Giver of abounding favours,
the Accepter of small praise,
the Grateful for little gratitude,
the Beneficent, the Benevolent,
Possessor of graciousness!

37,In Giving Thanks,His Supplication when Confessing his Shortcomings in Giving Thanks,"1. O God,
no one reaches a limit in thanking Thee
without acquiring that of Thy beneficence
which enjoins upon him thanksgiving,

2- nor does anyone reach a degree in obeying Thee, even if he strives,
without falling short
of what Thou deservest because of Thy bounty.

3- The most thankful of Thy servants has not the capacity to thank Thee,
and the most worshipful of them falls short of obeying Thee.

4- To none of them is due
Thy forgiveness through what he himself deserves
or Thy good pleasure for his own merit.

5- When Thou forgivest someone, it is through Thy graciousness,
and when Thou art pleased with someone, it is through Thy bounty.

6- Thou showest gratitude for the paltry for which Thou showest gratitude1
and Thou rewardest the small act in which Thou art obeyed,
so that it seems as if Thy servants' thanksgiving
for which Thou hast made incumbent their reward and made great their repayment
is an affair from which they could have held back without Thee,
and hence Thou wilt recompense them,
and whose cause is not in Thy hand,
and hence Thou wilt repay them.

7- Nay, my God, Thou hadst power over their affair
before they had power to worship Thee,
and Thou hadst prepared their reward
before they began to obey Thee;
and that because Thy wont is bestowal of bounty,
Thy custom beneficence,
Thy way pardon.

8- So all creatures confess
that Thou wrongest not him whom Thou punishest
and bear witness that Thou bestowest bounty upon him whom Thou pardonest.
Each admits that he has fallen short of what Thou meritest.

9- Had Satan not misled them from Thy obedience,
no disobeyer would have disobeyed Thee,
and had he not shown falsehood to them in the likeness of truth
no strayer would have gone astray from Thy path.

10- So glory be to Thee!
How manifest is Thy generosity in dealing with him who obeys or disobeys Thee!
Thou showest gratitude to the obedient
for that which Thou undertakest for him,
and Thou grantest a respite to the disobedient
in that within which Thou art able to hurry him.

11- Thou givest to each of them that which is not his due,
and Thou bestowest bounty upon each
in that wherein his works fall short.

12- Wert Thou to counterbalance for the obedient servant
that which Thou Thyself hadst undertaken,
he would be on the point of losing Thy reward
and seeing the end of Thy favour,
but through Thy generosity Thou hast repaid him
for a short, perishing term with a long, everlasting term,
and for a near, vanishing limit with an extended, abiding limit.

13- Then Thou dost not visit him with a settling of accounts for Thy provision
through which he gained strength to obey Thee,
nor dost Thou force him to make reckonings
for the organs he employed
to find the means to Thy forgiveness.
Wert Thou to do that to him,
it would take away everything for which he had laboured
and all wherein he had exerted himself
as repayment for the smallest of Thy benefits
and kindnesses,
and he would remain hostage before Thee
for Thy other favours.
So how can he deserve something of Thy reward?
Indeed, how?

14- This, my God, is the state of him who obeys Thee
and the path of him who worships Thee.
But as for him who disobeys Thy command
and goes against Thy prohibition,
Thou dost not hurry him to Thy vengeance,
so that he may seek to replace
his state in disobeying Thee
with the state of turning back to obey Thee,
though he deserved from the time he set out to disobey Thee
every punishment which Thou hast prepared
for all Thy creatures.

15- Through each chastisement which Thou hast kept back from him
and each penalty of Thy vengeance and Thy punishment which Thou hast delayed from him,
Thou hast refrained from Thy right
and shown good pleasure
in place of what Thou hast made obligatory.

16- So who is more generous, my God, than Thou?
And who is more wretched than he who perishes
in spite of Thee?
Indeed, who?
Thou art too blessed to be described by any but beneficence
and too generous for any but justice to be feared from Thee!
There is no dread that Thou wilt be unjust
toward him who disobeys Thee,
nor any fear of Thy neglecting to reward
him who satisfies Thee.2
So bless Muhammad and his Household,
give me my hope,
and increase me in that of Thy guidance
through which I may be successful in my works!
Surely Thou art All-kind, Generous.",(Supplication - 37),sajjadiyya_37.mp3,1,37,جب ادائے شکر میں کوتاہی کا اعتراف کرتے تو یہ دعا پڑھتے,دعا در اعتراف به ناتوانی از شکر,37-  دُعَاؤُهُ فِي الشُّكْرِ.,जब अदाए शुक्र में कोताही को क़बूल करते तो यह दुआ पढ़ते,Négliger le remerciement à Dieu,D,,,,,

the person wronged in my presence whom I did not help,
the favour conferred upon me for which I returned no thanks,
the evildoer who asked pardon from me and whom I did not pardon,
the needy person who asked from me and whom I preferred not over myself,
the right of a believer who possesses a right incumbent upon me which I did not fulfil,
the fault of a believer which became evident to me and which I did not conceal,
and every sin which presented itself to me and which I failed to avoid.

2- I ask pardon, my God,
for all of these and their likes,
with an asking of pardon in remorse
which may act as an admonisher
against similar things ahead of me.

3- So bless Muhammad and his Household
and make my remorse
for the slips into which I have fallen
and my determination to refrain from the evil deeds which present themselves to me

39,In Seeking Pardon and Mercy,His Supplication in Seeking Pardon and Mercy,"1- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
break my passion for every unlawful thing,
take away my craving for any sin,
and bar me from harming any believer, male or female,
and any Muslim, male or female!

2- O God, if any of Thy servants should harm me in what Thou hast forbidden
or violate me in what Thou hast interdicted,
and if he should pass into death with my complaint
or I come to have a complaint against him while he is alive,
forgive him what he did to me
and pardon him that through which he turned his back on me!
Inquire not from him about what he committed toward me
and expose him not through what he earned by me!
Make my open-handedness in pardoning such servants
and my contribution in charity toward them
the purest charity of the charitable
and the highest gift of those seeking nearness to Thee!

3- Recompense me for my pardoning them with Thy pardon
and for my supplicating for them with Thy mercy
so that each one of us may gain felicity through Thy bounty
and each may attain deliverance through Thy kindness!

4- O God, if there is a servant from among Thy servants whom
an ill visits on my account,
a harm touches from my direction,
or a wrong overtakes through me or because of me,
and should I fail to take care of his right
or go before him [in death] with his complaint,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
satisfy him toward me through Thy wealth,
and give him his full right from Thyself!

5- Then protect me from what Thy decision mandates
and save me from what Thy justice decides,
for my strength cannot bear Thy vengeance
and my power cannot stand up to Thy displeasure!
If Thou recompensest me with the right,
Thou wilt destroy me,
and if Thou dost not shield me in Thy mercy,
Thou wilt lay me waste.

6- O God, I ask Thee to grant, my God,
that whose giving will not decrease Thee,
and I ask Thee to carry
that whose carrying will not weigh Thee down:

7- My God, I ask Thee to give my soul,
which Thou didst not create to keep Thyself from evil
nor to find the way to profit.
No, Thou brought it forth
to demonstrate Thy power over its like
and to provide an argument against its similar.

8- I ask Thee to carry those of my sins whose carrying weighs me down
and I seek help from Thee in that whose heaviness oppresses me.

9- So bless Muhammad and his Household,
give to me my soul in spite of its wrongdoing,1
and appoint Thy mercy to carry my burden!
How many evildoers Thy mercy has overtaken!
How many wrongdoers Thy pardon has embraced!

10- So bless Muhammad and his Household
and make me the model of him whom Thou hast
aroused through Thy forbearance
from the deadly infirmities of the Senders
and saved through Thy giving success from the tangled plights of the sinners,
so that I may rise up freed by Thy pardon from the bonds of Thy displeasure
and released by Thy benefaction from the ties of Thy justice!

11- Surely if Thou dost that, my God,
Thou wilt do it to one who does not
deny deserving Thy punishment
or acquit himself from merit for Thy vengeance.

12- Do that, my God, for one
whose fear of Thee is greater than his craving from Thee,
whose hopelessness of deliverance is firmer than his hope for salvation!
Not that his hopelessness is despair,
nor that his expectation is deluded.
No, rather his good deeds are few
among his evil deeds
and his arguments are frail
in face of everything due from his acts.

13- But Thou, my God, art worthy that
the righteous not be deluded concerning Thee
and the sinners not lose hope in Thee,
for Thou art the All-mighty Lord who
holds back His bounty from none
and takes His full right from no one.

Holy are Thy names beyond those described!

40,When Death was Mentioned,His Supplication when Someone's Death was Announced to him or when he Remembered Death,"1- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
spare us drawn out expectations
and cut them short in us through sincerity of works,
that we may not hope expectantly for completing an hour after an hour,
closing a day after a day,
joining a breath to a breath,
or overtaking a step with a step!

2- Keep us safe from the delusions of expectations,
make us secure from their evils,
set up death before us in display. and let not our remembering of it come and go!

3- Appoint for us from among the righteous works a work
through which we will feel the homecoming to Thee as slow
and crave a quick joining with Thee,
so that death may be our intimate abode with which we are intimate,
our familiar place toward which we yearn,
and our next of kin whose coming we love!

4- When Thou bringest it to us and sendest it down upon us,
make us happy with it as a visitor, comfort us with its arrival,
make us not wretched through entertaining it,
degrade us not through its visit,
and appoint it one of the gates to Thy forgiveness
and the keys to Thy mercy!

obedient, not averse,
repentant, not disobedient or persisting,

bless Muhammad and his Household,
spread for me the bed of Thy honour,
bring me to the wateringholes of Thy mercy,
set me down in the midst of Thy Garden,
stamp me not with rejection by Thee,
deprive me not through disappointment by Thee,

2- settle not accounts with me for what I have committed,
make no reckoning with me for what I have earned,
display not what I have hidden,
expose not what I have covered over,
weigh not my works on the scales of fairness,
and make not my tidings known to the eyes of the crowd!

3- Conceal from them everything whose unfolding would shame me
and roll up before them all which would join me to disgrace with Thee!

4- Ennoble my degree through Thy good pleasure,
perfect my honour through Thy forgiveness,
rank me among the companions of the right hand,
direct me to the roads of the secure,
place me in the throng of the triumphant,

42,Upon Completing a Reading of the Qur'an,His Supplication upon Completing a Reading of the Qur’an,"O God, Thou hast helped me complete Thy Book, which Thou sent down as a light and appointed as a guardian over every book Thou hast sent down, preferring it over every narrative which Thou hast recounted, a separator, through which Thou hast separated Thy lawful from Thy unlawful, a Qur'an, through which Thou hast made plain the approaches to Thy ordinances, a book, which Thou hast distinguished very distinctly for Thy servants, a revelation, which Thou hast sent down, a sending down, upon Thy prophet Muhammad (Thy blessings be upon him and his Household).
Thou appointed it a light through following which we may be guided from the shadows of error and ignorance, a healing for him who turns ear toward hearing it with the understanding of attestation, a just balance whose tongue does not incline away from truth, a light of guidance whose proof is not extinguished before the witnesses, and a guidepost of deliverance, so that he who repairs straightway to its prescription will not go astray and he who clings to its preservation's handhold will not be touched by the hands of disasters.
O God, since Thou hast given us help to recite it and made smooth the roughness of our tongues through the beauty of its expression, place us among those who observe it as it should be observed, serve Thee by adhering in submission to the firm text of its verses, and seek refuge in admitting both its ambiguous parts and the elucidations of its clear signs!
O God, Thou sent it down upon Thy prophet Muhammad (God bless him and his household) in summary form, Thou inspired him with the science of its wonders to complement it, Thou made us the heirs of its knowledge as interpreters, Thou made us to surpass him who is ignorant of its knowledge, and Thou gave us strength over it to raise us above those not able to carry it. O God, just as Thou hast appointed our hearts as its carriers and made known to us through Thy mercy its nobility and excellence, so also bless Muhammad, its preacher, and his Household, its guardians, and place us among those who confess that it has come from Thee, lest doubt about attesting to it assail us, or deviation from its straightforward path shake us!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and make us one of those who hold fast to its cord, seek haven from its ambiguities in its fortified stronghold, rest in the shadow of its wing, find guidance in the brightness of its morning, follow the shining of its disclosure, acquire light from its lamp, and beg not guidance from any other! O God, just as through it Thou hast set up Muhammad as a guidepost to point to Thee and through his Household Thou hast made clear Thy good pleasure's roads to Thee, so also bless Muhammad and his Household and make the Qur'an our mediation to the noblest stations of Thy honour, a ladder by which we may climb to the place of safety, a cause for our being repaid with deliverance at the Plain of Resurrection, and a means whereby we may reach the bliss of the House of Permanence!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, lessen for us through the Qur'an the weight of heavy sins, give to us the excellent qualities of the pious, and make us follow the tracks of those who stood before Thee in the watches of the night and the ends of the day, such that Thou purifiest us from every defilement through its purification and makest us to follow the tracks of those who have taken illumination from its light and whom expectation has not distracted from works, cutting them off through its delusions' deceptions! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and appoint the Qur'an for us an intimate in the shadows of nights and a guardian against the instigations of Satan and confusing thoughts, for our feet an obstruction from passing to acts of disobedience, for our tongues a silencer without blight preventing a plunge into falsehood, for our limbs a restrainer from committing sins, and for the scrutiny of heedfulness rolled up in heedlessness an unroller, such that Thou attachest to our hearts the understanding of the Qur'an's wonders and its restraining similitudes which immovable mountains in all their solidity were too weak to carry!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and through the Qur'an make permanent the rightness of our outward selves, veil the ideas of confusing thoughts from the soundness of our innermost minds, wash away the dirt of our hearts and the ties of our heavy sins, gather our scattered affairs, quench the thirst of our burning heat in the standing place of the presentation to Thee, and clothe us in the robes of security on the Day of the Greatest Terror at our uprising!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and through the Qur'an redress our lack our destitution in poverty drive toward us the comforts of life and an abundance of plentiful provisions, turn aside blameworthy character traits and base moral qualities, and preserve us from the pit of unbelief and the motives for hypocrisy, such that the Qur'an may be for us at the resurrection a leader to Thy good pleasure and Thy gardens, for us in this world a protector against Thy displeasure and transgressing Thy bounds and for what is with Thee a witness by its declaring lawful the lawful and its declaring unlawful the unlawful!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and through the Qur'an make easy for our souls at death the distress of the driving, the effort of the moaning, and the succession of the rattling, when souls reach the throats and it is said, 'Where is the enchanter?'; when the angel of death discloses himself to seize them from behind the veils of unseen things, letting loose at them from the bow of destinies the arrows of the terror of lonesome separation, and mixing for them from sudden death a cup poisoned to the taste; and when departure and release for the hereafter come close to us, works become collars around the necks, and the graves become the haven until the appointed time of the Day of Encounter!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, make blessed for us the arrival at the house of decay and the drawn out residence between the layers of the earth, appoint the graves, after separation from this world, the best of our waystations, make roomy for us through Thy mercy the narrowness of our tombs, and disgrace us not among those present at the Resurrection through our ruinous sins! Through the Qur'an have mercy upon the lowliness of our station at the standing place of presentation to Thee, make firm the slips of our feet during the shaking of the bridge across hell on the day of passage over it, illuminate the darkness of our graves before the Uprising, and deliver us from every distress on the Day of Resurrection and from the hardships of terrors on the Day of Disaster! Whiten our faces on the day when the faces of wrongdoers are blackened during the Day of Regret and Remorse, appoint love for us in the breasts of the faithful, and make not life for us troublesome! O God, bless Muhammad, Thy servant and Thy messenger, just as He delivered Thy message, executed Thy command, and counselled Thy servants!
O God, on the Day of Resurrection make our Prophet (Thy blessings be upon him and his Household) the nearest of the prophets to Thee in seat, the ablest of them before Thee with intercession, the greatest of them with Thee in measure, and the most eminent of them with Thee in rank! O God, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, ennoble his edifice, magnify his proof, make weighty his balance, accept his intercession, bring near his mediation, whiten his face, complete his light, and raise his degree! Make us live according to his Sunna, make us die in his creed, take us on his road, make us travel his path, place us among the people who obey him, muster us in his band, lead us to up his pool, and give us to drink of his cup!
And bless Muhammad and his Household, with a blessing through which Thou wilt take him to the most excellent of Thy good, Thy bounty, and Thy generosity for which he hopes! Thou art Possessor of boundless mercy and generous bounty. O God, repay him for Thy messages which he delivered, Thy signs which he passed on, the good counsel he gave to Thy servants, and the struggle he undertook in Thy way, with the best Thou hast repaid any of Thy angels brought nigh and Thy prophets sent out and chosen! And upon him and his Household, the good, the pure, be peace, God's mercy, and His blessings!",(Supplication - 42),sajjadiyya_42.mp3,1,42,دعاۓ ختم القرآن,دعا به وقت ختم قران,42-  دُعَاؤُهُ عِنْدَ خَتْمِهِ الْقُرْآنَ.,क़ुरआन ख़तम करने के बाद की दुआ,Invocation de la terminaison de la lecture entière du Coran,R,,1.0,58.0,,
43,When he Looked at the New Crescent Moon,His Supplication when he Looked at the New Crescent Moon,"O obedient creature, speedy and untiring, frequenter of the mansions of determination, moving about in the sphere of governance! I have faith in Him who lights up darknesses through thee, illuminates jet-black shadows by thee, appointed thee one of the signs of His kingdom and one of the marks of His authority, and humbled thee through increase and decrease, rising and setting, illumination and eclipse. In all of this thou art obedient to Him, prompt toward His will. Glory be to Him! How wonderful is what He has arranged in thy situation! How subtle what He has made for thy task! He has made thee the key to a new month for a new situation.
So I ask God, my Lord and thy Lord, my Creator and thy Creator, my Determiner and thy Determiner, my Form-giver and thy Form-giver, that He bless Muhammad and his Household and appoint thee a crescent of blessings not effaced by days and of purity not defiled by sins; a crescent of security from blights and of safety from evil deeds; a crescent of auspiciousness containing no misfortune, of prosperity accompanied by no adversity, of ease not mixed with difficulty, of good unstained by evil; a crescent of security and faith, favour and good-doing, safety and submission!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, place us among the most satisfied of those over whom the crescent has risen, the purest of those who have looked upon it, the most fortunate of those who have worshipped Thee under it; give us the success during [the new month] to repent, preserve us within it from misdeeds, guard us therein from pursuing disobedience to Thee, allot to us within it thanksgiving for Thy favour, clothe us during it in the shields of well-being, and complete for us Thy kindness by perfecting therein obedience to Thee! Surely Thou art All-kind, Praiseworthy. And bless Muhammad and his Household, the good, the pure.",(Supplication - 43),sajjadiyya_43.mp3,1,43,دعاۓ رویت ہلال,دعا هنگام نگاه کردن به هلال,43-  دُعَاؤُهُ إِذَا نَظَرَ إِلَى الْهِلَالِ.,नया चाँद देखने के बाद की दुआ,Invocation du premier croissant de la lune (le premier jour du mois lunaire),R,,1.0,59.0,,
44,For the Coming of the Month of Ramadan,His Supplication for the Coming of the Month of Ramazan,"Praise belongs to God who guided us to His praise and placed us among the people of praise, that we might be among the thankful for His beneficence and that He might recompense us for that with the recompense of the good-doers! And praise belongs to God who showed favour to us through His religion, singled us out for His creed, and directed us onto the roads of His beneficence, in order that through His kindness we might travel upon them to His good pleasure, a praise which He will accept from us and through which He will be pleased with us!
And praise belongs to God who appointed among those roads His month, the month of Ramadan, the month of fasting, the month of submission, the month of purity, the month of putting to test, the month of standing in prayer, in which the Qur'an was sent down as guidance to the people, and as clear signs of the Guidance and the Separator! He clarified its excellence over other months by the many sacred things and well-known excellencies which He placed therein, for He made unlawful in it what He declared lawful in others to magnify it, He prohibited foods and drinks in it to honour it, and He appointed for it a clear time which He (majestic and mighty is He) allows not to be set forward and accepts not to be placed behind. Then He made one of its nights surpass the nights of a thousand months and named it the Night of Decree; in it the angels and the Spirit descend by the leave of their Lord upon every command, a peace constant in blessings until the rising of the dawn upon whomsoever He will of His servants according to the decision He has made firm.
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, inspire us with knowledge of its excellence, veneration of its inviolability, and caution against what Thou hast forbidden within it, and help us to fast in it by our restraining our limbs from acts of disobedience toward Thee and our employing them in that which pleases Thee, so that we lend not our ears to idle talk and hurry not with our eyes to diversion, we stretch not our hands toward the forbidden and stride not with our feet toward the prohibited, our bellies hold only what Thou hast made lawful and our tongues speak only what Thou hast exemplified, we undertake nothing but what brings close to Thy reward and pursue nothing but what protects from Thy punishment! Then rid all of that from the false show of the false showers and the fame seeking of the fame seekers, lest we associate therein anything with Thee or seek therein any object of desire but Thee!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, in it make us attend to the appointed moments of the five prayers within the bounds Thou hast set, the obligations Thou hast decreed, the duties Thou hast assigned, and the times Thou hast specified; and in the prayers make us alight in the station of the keepers of their stations, the guardians of their pillars, their performers in their times, as Thy servant and Thy messenger set down in his Sunna (Thy blessings be upon him and his Household) in their bowings, their prostrations, and all their excellent acts, with the most complete and ample ritual purity and the most evident and intense humility! Give us success in this month to tighten our bonds of kin with devotion and gifts, attend to our neighbours with bestowal and giving, rid our possessions from claims, purify them through paying the alms, go back to him who has gone far from us, treat justly him who has wronged us, make peace with him who shows enmity toward us (except him who is regarded as an enemy in Thee and for Thee, for he is the enemy whom we will not befriend, the party whom we will not hold dear), and seek nearness to Thee through blameless works which will purify us from sins and preserve us from renewing faults, so that none of Thy angels will bring for Thee the kinds of obedience and sorts of nearness-seeking unless they be less than what we bring!
O God, I ask Thee by the right of this month and by the right of him who worships Thee within it from its beginning to the time of its passing, whether angel Thou hast brought nigh to Thee, prophet Thou hast sent, or righteous servant Thou hast singled out, that Thou bless Muhammad and his Household, make us worthy of the generosity Thou hast promised Thy friends, make incumbent for us what Thou hast made incumbent for those who go to great lengths in obeying Thee, and place us in the ranks of those who deserve through Thy mercy the highest elevation! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, turn us aside from deviation in professing Thy Unity, falling short in magnifying Thee, doubt in Thy religion, blindness toward Thy path, heedlessness of Thy inviolability, and being deceived by Thy enemy, the accursed Satan!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, and when in every night of this month's nights Thou hast necks which Thy pardon will release and Thy forgiveness disregard, place our necks among those necks and place us among the best folk and companions of this our month! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, efface our sins along with the effacing of its crescent moon, and make us pass forth from the ill effects of our acts with the passing of its days, until it leaves us behind, while within it Thou hast purified us of offenses and rid us of evil deeds! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, and should we go off to one side in this month, set us aright; should we swerve, point us straight; and should Thy enemy Satan enwrap us, rescue us from him!
O God, fill this month with our worship of Thee, adorn its times with our obedience toward Thee, help us during its daytime with its fast, and in its night with prayer and pleading toward Thee, humility toward Thee, and lowliness before Thee, so that its daytime may not bear witness against our heedlessness, nor its night against our neglect! O God, make us like this in the other months and days as long as Thou givest us life, and place us among Thy righteous servants, those who shall inherit Paradise, therein dwelling forever, those who give what they give, while their hearts quake, that they are returning to their Lord, those who vie in good works, outracing to them! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household in every time, in all moments, and in every state, to the number that Thou hast blessed whomsoever Thou hast blessed and to multiples of all that, through multiples which none can count but Thee! Surely Thou art Accomplisher of what Thou desirest!",(Supplication - 44),sajjadiyya_44.mp3,1,44,استقبال ماہ رمضان کی دعا,دعا به وقت فرا رسیدن ماه مبارک رمضان,44-  دُعَاؤُهُ لِدُخُوْلِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ.,रमज़ान के महीने के इस्तेक़बाल करने की दुआ,Invocation de l'entrée au mois de Ramadan,R,,14.0,52.0,,
45,Bidding Farewell to the Month of Ramadan,His Supplication in Bidding Farewell to the Month of Ramazan,"O God, O He who desires no repayment! O He who shows no remorse at bestowal! O He who rewards not His servant tit for tat! Thy kindness is a new beginning, Thy pardon gratuitous bounty, Thy punishment justice, Thy decree a choice for the best! If Thou bestowest, Thou stainest not Thy bestowal with obligation, and if Thou withholdest, Thou withholdest not in transgression. Thou showest gratitude to him who thanks Thee, while Thou hast inspired him to thank Thee. Thou rewardest him who praises Thee, while though Thou hast taught him Thy praise.
Thou coverest him whom, if Thou willed, Thou wouldst expose, and Thou art generous toward him from whom, if Thou willed,Thou wouldst withhold. Both are worthy of Thy exposure and withholding, but Thou hast founded Thy acts upon gratuitous bounty, channelled Thy power into forbearance, received him who disobeyed Thee with clemency, and disregarded him who intended wrongdoing against himself. Thou awaitest their turning back without haste and refrainest from rushing them toward repentance, so that the perisher among them may not perish because of Thee and the wretched may not be wretched through Thy favour, but only after Thy prolonged excusing him and successive arguments against him, as an act of generosity through Thy pardon, O Generous, and an act of kindliness through Thy tenderness, O Clement!
It is Thou who hast opened for Thy servants a door to Thy pardon, which Thou hast named 'repentance' Thou hast placed upon that door a pointer from Thy revelation, lest they stray from it: Thou hast said (blessed are Thy names), Repent toward God with unswerving repentance! It may be that Thy Lord will acquit of your evil deeds and will admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow, upon the day when God will not degrade the Prophet and those who have faith along with him, their light running before them and on their right hands, and they say:
Our Lord, complete for us our light, and forgive us! Surely Thou art powerful over everything.' What is the excuse of him who remains heedless of entering that house after the opening of the door and the setting up of the pointer? . It is Thou who hast raised the price against Thyself to the advantage of Thy servants, desiring their profit in their trade with Thee, their triumph through reaching Thee, and their increase on account of Thee, for Thou hast said (blessed is Thy Name and high art Thou exalted), Whoso brings a good deed shall have ten the like of it, and whoso brings an evil deed shall only be recompensed the like of it.
Thou hast said, The likeness of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains; so God multiplies unto whom He wills. Thou hast said, Who is he that will lend to God a good loan, and He will multiply it for him manifold? And Thou hast sent down in the Qur'an similar verses on the multiplying of good deeds. It is Thou who hast pointed them through Thy speech from Thy Unseen and Thy encouragement in which lies their good fortune toward that which hadst Thou covered it from them their eyes would not have perceived, their ears would not have heard, and their imaginations would not have grasped, for Thou hast said, Remember Me and I will remember you be thankful to Me, and be you not thankless towards Me! Thou hast said, If you are thankful, surely I will increase you, but if you are thankless, My chastisement is surely terrible; And Thou hast said, Supplicate Me and I will respond to you, surely those who wax too proud to worship Me shall enter Gehenna utterly abject.
Hence Thou hast named supplicating Thee 'worship' and refraining from it 'waxing proud', and Thou hast threatened that the refraining from it would yield entrance into Gehenna in utter abjection. So they remember Thee for Thy kindness, they thank Thee for Thy bounty, they supplicate Thee by Thy command, and they donate for Thee in order to seek Thy increase; in all this lies their deliverance from Thy wrath and their triumph through Thy good pleasure. Were any creature himself to direct another creature to the like of that to which Thou Thyself hast directed Thy servants, he would be described by beneficence, qualified by kindness, and praised by every tongue. So to Thee belongs praise as long as there is found a way to praise Thee and as long as there remains for praising words by which Thou may be praised and meanings which may be spent in praise!
O He who shows Himself praiseworthy to His servants through beneficence and bounty, flooding them with kindness and graciousness! How much Thy favour has been spread about among us, Thy kindness lavished upon us, and Thy goodness singled out for us! Thou hast guided us to Thy religion which Thou hast chosen, Thy creed with which Thou art pleased, and Thy path which Thou hast made smooth, and Thou hast shown us proximity to Thee and arrival at Thy generosity! O God, among the choicest of those duties and the most special of those obligations Thou hast appointed the month of Ramadan, which Thou hast singled out from other months, chosen from among all periods and eras, and preferred over all times of the year through the Qur'an and the Light which Thou sent down within it, the faith which Thou multiplied by means of it, the fasting which Thou obligated therein, the standing in prayer which Thou encouraged at its time, and the Night of Decree which Thou magnified therein, the night which is better than a thousand months. Through it Thou hast preferred us over the other communities and through its excellence Thou hast chosen us to the exclusion of the people of the creeds.
We fasted by Thy command in its daylight, we stood in prayer with Thy help in its night, presenting ourselves by its fasting and its standing to the mercy which Thou hast held up before us, and we found through it the means to Thy reward. And Thou art full of what is sought from Thee, munificent with what is asked of Thy bounty, and near to him who strives for Thy nearness. This month stood among us in a standing place of praise, accompanied us with the companionship of one approved, and profited us with the most excellent profit of the world's creatures. Then it parted from us at the completion of its time, the end of its term, and the fulfilment of its number. So we bid farewell to it with the farewell of one whose parting pains us, whose leaving fills us with gloom and loneliness, and to whom we have come to owe a safeguarded claim, an observed inviolability, and a discharged right. We say: Peace be upon thee, O greatest month of God! O festival of His friends! Peace be upon thee, O most noble of accompanying times!
O best of months in days and hours! Peace be upon thee, month in which expectations come near and good works are scattered about! Peace be upon thee, Comrade who is great in worth when found and who torments through absence when lost, anticipated friend whose parting gives pain! Peace be upon thee, familiar who brought comfort in coming, thus making happy, who left loneliness in going, thus giving anguish! -Peace be upon thee, neighbour in whom hearts became tender and sins became few! Peace be upon thee, helper who aided against Satan, companion who made easy the paths of good-doing! Peace be upon thee How many became freedmen of God within thee! How happy those who observed the respect due to thee! Peace be upon thee How many the sins thou erased! How many the kinds of faults thou covered over! Peace be upon thee How drawn out wert thou for the sinners! How awesome wert thou in the hearts of the faithful!
Peace be upon thee, month with which no days compete! Peace be upon thee, month which is peace in all affairs! Peace be upon thee, thou whose companionship is not disliked, thou whose friendly mixing is not blamed! Peace be upon thee, just as thou hast entered upon us with blessings and cleansed us of the defilement of offenses! Peace be upon thee Thou art not bid farewell in annoyance nor is thy fasting left in weariness! Peace be upon thee, object of seeking before thy time, object of sorrow before thy passing! Peace be upon thee How much evil was turned away from us through thee! How much good flowed upon us because of thee! Peace be upon thee and upon the Night of Decree which is better than a thousand months! Peace be upon thee How much we craved thee yesterday! How intensely we shall yearn for thee tomorrow!
Peace be upon thee and upon thy bounty which has now been made unlawful to us and upon thy blessings gone by which have now been stripped away from us! O God, we are the people of this month. Through it Thou hast ennobled us and given us success because of Thy kindness, while the wretched are ignorant of its time. Made unlawful to them is its bounty because of their wretchedness. Thou art the patron of the knowledge of it by which Thou hast preferred us, and its prescribed practices to which Thou hast guided us. We have undertaken, through Thy giving success, its fasting and its standing in prayer, but with shortcomings, and we have performed little of much. O God, so to Thee belongs praise, in admission of evil doing and confession of negligence, and to Thee belongs remorse firmly knitted in our hearts and seeking of pardon sincerely uttered by our tongues.
Reward us, in spite of the neglect that befell us in this month, with a reward through which we may reach the bounty desired from it and win the varieties of its craved stores! Make incumbent upon us Thy pardon for our falling short of Thy right in this month and make our lives which lie before us reach the coming month of Ramadan! Once Thou hast made us reach it, help us perform the worship of which Thou art worthy, cause us to undertake the obedience which Thou deservest, and grant us righteous works that we may fulfil Thy right in these two months of the months of time.
O God, as for the small and large sins which we have committed in this our month, the misdeeds into which we have fallen, and the offenses which we have earned purposefully or in forgetfulness, wronging ourselves thereby or violating the respect due to others, bless Muhammad and his Household, cover us over with Thy covering, pardon us through Thy pardoning, place us not before the eyes of the gloaters because of that, stretch not toward us the tongues of the defamers, and employ us in that which will alleviate and expiate whatever Thou disapprovest from us within it through Thy clemency which does not run out, and Thy bounty which does not diminish! . O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, redress our being afflicted by our month, bless us in this day of our festival and our fast-breaking, make it one of the best of days that have passed over us, the greatest in attracting Thy pardon, and the most effacing toward sins, and forgive us our sins, both the concealed and the public!
O God, with the passing of this month make us pass forth from our offenses, with its departure make us depart from our evil deeds, and appoint us thereby among its most felicitous people, the most plentiful of them in portion, and the fullest of them in share! O God, when any person observes this month as it should be observed, safeguards its inviolability as it should be safeguarded, attends to its bounds as they should be attended to, fears its misdeeds as they should be feared, or seeks nearness to Thee with any act of nearness-seeking which makes incumbent upon him Thy good pleasure and bends toward him Thy mercy, give to us the like [of that] from Thy wealth and bestow it upon us in multiples through Thy bounty, for Thy bounty does not diminish, Thy treasuries do not decrease but overflow, the mines of Thy beneficence are not exhausted, and Thy bestowal is the bestowal full of delight!
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and write for us the like of the wages of him who fasted in it or worshipped Thee within it until the Day of Resurrection! O God, we repent to Thee in our day of fast-breaking, which Thou hast appointed for the faithful a festival and a joy and for the people of Thy creed a time of assembly and gathering, from every misdeed we did, ill work we sent ahead, or evil thought we secretly conceived, the repentance of one who does not harbour a return to sin and who afterwards will not go back to offense, an unswerving repentance rid of doubt and wavering. So accept it from us, be pleased with us, and fix us within it! O God, provide us with fear of the threatened punishment and yearning for the promised reward, so that we may find the pleasure of that for which we supplicate Thee and the sorrow of that from which we seek sanctuary in Thee! And place us with Thee among the repenters, those upon whom Thou hast made Thy love obligatory and from whom Thou hast accepted the return to obeying Thee! O Most Just of the just!
O God, show forbearance toward our fathers and our mothers and all the people of our religion, those who have gone and those who will pass by, until the Day of Resurrection! O God, bless our prophet Muhammad and his Household, as Thou hast blessed Thy angels brought nigh, bless him and his Household, as Thou hast blessed Thy prophets sent out, bless him and his Household, as Thou hast blessed Thy righteous servants and better than that, O Lord of the worlds! a blessing whose benediction will reach us, whose benefit will attain to us, and through which our supplication may be granted! Thou art the most generous of those who are beseeched, the most sufficient of those in whom confidence is had, the most bestowing of those from whom bounty is asked, and Thou art powerful over everything!",(Supplication - 45),sajjadiyya_45.mp3,1,45,وداع ماہ رمضان کی دعا,دعا به هنگام وداع با ماه مبارک رمضان,45-  دُعَاؤُهُ لِوَدَاعِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ.,रमज़ान महीने की विदाई के वक़्त की दुआ,Invocation d'adieu au mois de Ramadan,R,,14.0,118.0,,

5- O He who slaps not the brow of the people of boldness toward Him with rejection!

6- O He who collects the little that is given to Him
and shows gratitude for the paltry that is done for Him!

7- O He who shows gratitude for the small and rewards with the great!

8- O He who comes close to him who comes close to Him!

9- O He who invites to Himself him who turns his back on Him!

10- O He who changes not favour1 and rushes not to vengeance!

11- O He who causes the good deed to bear fruit
so that He may make it grow,
and overlooks the evil deed so that He may efface it!

12- Hopes turn back with needs fulfilled short of the extent of Thy generosity,
the cups of requests fill up with the overflow of Thy munificence,
and attributes fall apart without reaching Thy description.
For to Thee belongs the highest highness
above everything high,
and the most glorious majesty
beyond every majesty!

13- Everything majestic before Thee is small,
everything eminent beside Thy eminence vile!
Those who reach other than Thee are disappointed,
those who present themselves to other than Thee
have lost,
those who stay with other than Thee have perished,
and those who retreat - except those who retreat to Thy bounty - are desolate!

14- Thy door is open to the beseechers,
Thy munificence free to the askers,
Thy help near to the help-seekers!

15- The expectant are not disappointed by Thee,
those who present themselves
despair not of Thy bestowal,
the forgiveness-seekers
become not wretched through Thy vengeance!

16- Thy provision is spread among those who disobey Thee,
Thy clemency presents itself to those hostile toward Thee,
Thy habit is beneficence toward the evildoers,
and Thy wont is to spare the transgressors,
so much so that Thy lack of haste deludes them from returning,
and Thy disregard bars them from desisting!

17- Thou actest without haste toward them
so that they will come back to Thy command
and Thou disregardest them confident in the permanence of Thy kingdom,
so Thou sealest him who is worthy of it with felicity,
and Thou abandonest him who is worthy of it to wretchedness!

18- All of them come home to Thy decree,
their affairs revert to Thy command;
Thy authority grows not feeble through their drawn out term,
Thy proof is not refuted by the failure to hurry after them.

19- Thy argument is established, never refuted,
Thy authority fixed, never removed.
Permanent woe belongs
to him who inclines away from Thee,
forsaking disappointment
to him who is disappointed by Thee,
and the most wretched wretchedness
to him who is deluded about Thee!

20- How much he will move about in Thy chastisement!
How long he will frequent Thy punishment!
How far his utmost end from relief!
How he will despair of an easy exit!
[All of this] as justice from Thy decree
(Thou art not unjust in it!),
and equity from Thy judgement
(Thou dost not act wrongfully against him!).

21- Thou supported the arguments,
tested the excuses,
began with threats,
showed gentleness with encouragement,
struck similitudes,
made long the respite,
delayed,
while Thou art able to hurry,
and acted without haste,
while Thou art full of quick accomplishment!

22- Not because of
incapacity is Thy slowness,
feebleness Thy giving respite,
heedlessness Thy showing restraint,
dissemblance Thy waiting!
But that Thy argument be more conclusive,
Thy generosity more perfect,
Thy beneficence more exhaustive,
Thy favour more complete!
All of this has been and always was,
is and ever will be.

23- Thy argument is greater
than that its totality be described,
Thy glory more elevated
than that it be limited in its core,
Thy favour more abundant
than that its entirety be counted,
Thy beneficence more abundant
than that thanks be given for its least amount!

24- Speechlessness has made me fall short of praising Thee,
restraint has made me powerless to glorify Thee,
and the most I can do is admit to inability,
not out of desire, my God, but out of incapacity.

25- So here I am:
I repair to Thee by coming forward,
and I ask from Thee good support
So bless Muhammad and his Household,
hear my whispered words, grant my supplication,
seal not my day with disappointment,
slap not my brow by rejecting my request,
and make noble my coming from Thee and my going back to Thee!
Surely Thou art not constrained by what Thou desirest,
nor incapable of what Thou art asked!
Thou art powerful over everything,2

47,On the Day of Arafa,His Supplication on the Day of Arafah,"Praise belongs to God, Lord of the worlds! O God, to Thee belongs praise! Originator of the heavens and the earth! Possessor of majesty and munificence! Lord of lords! Object of worship of every worshiper! Creator of every creature! Inheritor of all things! There is nothing like Him, knowledge of nothing escapes Him, He encompasses everything, and He is watchful over everything. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the Unique, the Alone, the Single, the Isolated. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the Generous, the Generously Bestowing, the All-mighty, the Mightily Exalted, the Magnificent, the Magnificently Magnified. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the All-high, the Sublimely High, the Strong in prowess. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the All-merciful, the All-compassionate, the All-knowing, the All-wise. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the All-hearing, the All-seeing, the Eternal, the All-aware.
Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the Generous, the Most Generous, the Everlasting, the Most Everlasting. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the First before every one, the Last after every number. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, the Close in His highness, the High in His closeness. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou, Possessor of radiance and glory, magnificence and praise. Thou art God, there is no god but Thou. Thou hast brought forth the things without root, formed what Thou hast formed without exemplar, and originated the originated things without limitation. It is Thou who hast ordained each thing with an ordination, eased each thing with an easing, and governed everything below Thyself with a governing. It is Thou whom no associate helps with Thy creation and no vizier aids in Thy command. Thou hast no witness and no equal.
It is Thou who willed, and what Thou willed was unfailing, who decreed, and what Thou decreed was just, who decided, and what Thou decided was fair. It is Thou whom place does not contain, before whose authority no authority stands up, and whom no proof or explication can thwart. It is Thou who hast counted everything in numbers, appointed for everything a term, and ordained everything with an ordination. It is Thou before whose selfness imaginations fall short, before whose howness understandings have no incapacity, and the place of whose whereness eyes perceive not. It is Thou who hast no bounds, lest Thou be bounded, who art not exemplified, lest Thou be found, who dost not beget, lest Thou be begotten. It is Thou with whom there is no opposite, lest it contend with Thee, who hast no equal, lest it vie with Thee, who hast no rival, lest it resist Thee.
It is Thou who art He who began, devised, brought forth, originated, and made well all that He made. Glory be to Thee! How majestic is Thy station! How high Thy place among the places! How cleanly Thy Separator cleaves with the truth! Glory be to Thee! The Gentle how gentle Thou art! The Clement how clement Thou art! The Wise how knowing Thou art! Glory be to Thee! The King how invincible Thou art! The Munificent how full of plenty Thou art! The Elevated how elevated Thou art! Possessor of radiance and glory, magnificence and praise! Glory be to Thee! Thou hast stretched forth Thy hand with good things, and from Thee guidance has come to be known, so he who begs from Thee religion or this world will find Thee. Glory be to Thee! Whatever passes in Thy knowledge is subjected to Thee, all below Thy Throne are humbled before Thy mightiness, and every one of Thy creatures follows Thee in submission. Glory be to Thee! Thou art not sensed, nor touched, nor felt, nor beguiled, nor held back, nor challenged, nor kept up with, nor resisted, nor deceived, nor circumvented. Glory be to Thee! Thy path is smooth ground, Thy command right guidance, and Thou art a living, eternal refuge.
Glory be to Thee! Thy word is decisive, Thy decree unfailing, Thy will resolute. Glory be to Thee! None can reject Thy wish, none can change Thy words. Glory be to Thee, Outdazzling in signs, Creator of the heavens, Author of the spirits! To Thee belongs praise, a praise that will be permanent with Thy permanence! To Thee belongs praise, a praise everlasting through Thy favour! To Thee belongs praise, a praise that will parallel Thy benefaction! To Thee belongs praise, a praise that will increase Thy good pleasure!
To Thee belongs praise, a praise along with the praise of every praiser and a thanksgiving before which falls short the thanksgiving of every thanksgiver; a praise which is suitable for none but Thee and through which nearness is sought to none but Thee; a praise which will make permanent the first [bounty] and call forth the permanence of the last; a praise which will multiply through recurrence of times and increase through successive doublings; a praise which the guardians will not be able to number and which exceeds what the writers number in Thy Book; a praise which will counterbalance Thy glorious Throne and equal Thy elevated Footstool; a praise whose reward with Thee will be complete and whose recompense will comprise every recompense; a praise whose outward conforms to its inward, and whose inward conforms to correct intention; a praise with whose like no creature has praised Thee and whose excellence none knows but Thou; a praise in which he who strives to multiply Thy praise will be helped and he who draws the bow to the utmost in fulfilling it will be confirmed; a praise which will gather all the praise which Thou hast created and tie together all which Thou wilt afterwards create; a praise than which no praise is nearer to Thy word and than which none is greater from any who praise Thee; a praise whose fullness will obligate increase through Thy generosity and to which Thou wilt join increase after increase as graciousness from Thee; a praise that will befit the generosity of Thy face and meet the might of Thy majesty!
My Lord, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, the distinguished, the chosen, the honoured, the brought nigh, with the most excellent of Thy blessings, benedict him with the most complete of Thy benedictions, and have mercy upon him with the most enjoyable of Thy mercies! My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a fruitful blessing, more fruitful than which there is no blessing! Bless him with a growing blessing, more growing than which there is no blessing! And bless him with a pleasing blessing, beyond which there is no blessing! My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will please him and increase his good pleasure! Bless him with a blessing which will please Thee and increase Thy good pleasure toward him! And bless him with a blessing through other than which Thou wilt not be pleased for him, and for which Thou seest no one else worthy! My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will pass beyond Thy good pleasure, be continuous in its continuity through Thy subsistence, and never be spent, just as Thy words will never be spent!
My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will tie together the blessings of Thy angels, Thy prophets, Thy messengers, and those who obey Thee, comprise the blessings of Thy servants, jinn or mankind, and those worthy of Thy response, and bring together the blessings of every one of the kinds of Thy creatures which Thou hast sown and authored! My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which will encompass every blessing, bygone and new! Bless him and his Household with a blessing which is pleasing to Thee and everyone below Thee and will bring forth with all that a blessing with which Thou wilt multiply those blessings and increase them through the recurrence of days with an increasing in multiples which none can count but Thou! My Lord, bless the best of his Household, those whom Thou hast chosen for Thy command, appointed the treasurers of Thy knowledge, the guardians of Thy religion, Thy vicegerents in Thy earth, and Thy arguments against Thy servants, purified from uncleanness and defilement through a purification by Thy desire, and made the mediation to Thee and the road to Thy Garden! My Lord, bless Muhammad and his Household with a blessing which makes plentiful Thy gifts and generosity, perfects for them Thy bestowals and awards, and fills out their share of Thy kindly acts and benefits!
My Lord, bless him and his Household with a blessing whose first has no term, whose term has no limit, and whose last has no utmost end! My Lord, bless them to the weight of Thy Throne and all below it, the amount that fills the heavens and all above them, the number of Thy earths and all below and between them, a blessing that will bring them near to Thee in proximity, please Thee and them, and be joined to its likes forever! O God, surely Thou hast confirmed Thy religion in all times with an Imam whom Thou hast set up as a guidepost to Thy servants and a lighthouse in Thy lands, after his cord has been joined to Thy cord! Thou hast appointed him the means to Thy good pleasure, made obeying him obligatory, cautioned against disobeying him, and commanded following his commands, abandoning his prohibitions, and that no forward-goer go ahead of him or back-keeper keep back from him! So he is the preservation of the shelter-seekers, the cave of the faithful, the handhold of the adherents, and the radiance of the worlds!
O God, so inspire Thy guardian to give thanks for that in which Thou hast favoured him, inspire us with the like concerning him, grant him an authority from Thee to help him, open for him an easy opening, aid him with Thy mightiest pillar, brace up his back, strengthen his arm, guard him with Thy eye, defend him with Thy safeguarding, help him with Thy angels, and assist him with Thy most victorious troops! Through him establish Thy Book, Thy bounds, Thy laws, and the norms of Thy Messenger's Sunna (Thy blessings, O God, be upon him and his Household), bring to life the guideposts of Thy religion, deadened by the wrongdoers, burnish the rust of injustice from Thy way, sift the adversity from Thy road, eliminate those who deviate from Thy path, and erase those who seek crookedness in Thy straightness! Make his side mild toward Thy friends, stretch forth his hand over Thy enemies, give us his clemency, his mercy, his tenderness, his sympathy, and make us his hearers and obeyers, strivers toward his good pleasure, assistants in helping him and defending him, and brought near through that to Thee and Thy Messenger (Thy blessings, O God, be upon him and his Household).
O God, and bless the friends [of the Imams], the confessors of their station, the keepers to their course, the pursuers of their tracks, the clingers to their handhold, the adherents to their guardianship, the followers of their imamate, the submitters to their command, the strivers to obey them, the awaiters of their days, the directors of their eyes toward them, with blessings blessed, pure, growing, fresh, and fragrant! Give them and their spirits peace, bring together their affair in reverential fear, set right their situations, turn toward them, Surely Thou art Ever-turning, All-compassionate and the Best of forgivers, and place us with them in the Abode of Peace, through Thy mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful! O God, this is the Day of 'Arafa, a day which Thou hast made noble, given honour, and magnified. Within it Thou hast spread Thy mercy, showed kindness through Thy pardon, and made plentiful Thy giving, and by it Thou hast been bounteous toward Thy servants. I am Thy servant whom Thou favoured before creating him and after creating him. Thou madest him one of those whom Thou guided to Thy religion, gavest success in fulfilling Thy right, preserved through Thy cord, included within Thy party, and directed aright to befriend Thy friends and show enmity to Thine enemies.
Then Thou commanded him, but he did not follow Thy commands, Thou restricted Him, but he did not heed Thy restrictions, Thou prohibited him from disobedience toward Thee, but he broke Thy command by doing what Thou hadst prohibited, not in contention with Thee, nor to display pride toward Thee; on the contrary, his caprice called him to that which Thou hadst set apart and cautioned against, and he was helped in that by Thy enemy and his enemy. So he went ahead with it knowing Thy threat, hoping for Thy pardon, and relying upon Thy forbearance, though he was the most obligated of Thy servants given Thy kindness toward him not to do so. Here I am, then, before Thee, despised, lowly, humble, abject, fearful, confessing the dreadful sins with which I am burdened and the great offenses that I have committed, seeking sanctuary in Thy forgiveness, asking shelter in Thy mercy, and certain that no sanctuary-giver will give me sanctuary from Thee and no withholder will hold me back from Thee. So act kindly toward me, just as Thou actest kindly by Thy shielding him who commits sins, be munificent toward me, just as Thou art munificent by pardoning him who throws himself before Thee, and show kindness to me, just as it is nothing great for Thee to show kindness by forgiving him who expectantly hopes in Thee! Appoint for me in this day an allotment through which I may attain a share of Thy good pleasure, and send me not back destitute of that with which Thy worshipers return from among Thy servants!
Though I have not forwarded the righteous deeds which they have forwarded, I have forwarded the profession of Thy Unity and the negation from Thee of opposites, rivals, and likenesses, I have come to Thee by the gateways by which Thou hast commanded that people come, and I have sought nearness to Thee through that without seeking nearness through which none gains nearness to Thee. Then I followed all this with repeated turning toward Thee, lowliness and abasement before Thee, good opinion of Thee, and trust in what is with Thee; and to that I coupled hope in Thee, since the one who hopes in Thee is seldom disappointed! I asked Thee with the asking of one vile, lowly, pitiful, poor, fearful, seeking sanctuary; all that in fear and pleading seeking refuge and asking shelter, not presumptuous through the pride of the proud, nor exalting myself with the boldness of the obedient, nor presumptuous of the intercession of the interceders. For I am still the least of the least and the lowliest of the lowly, like a dust mote or less! O He who does not hurry the evildoers nor restrain those living in ease! O He who shows kindness through releasing the stumblers and gratuitous bounty through respiting the offenders! I am the evildoer, the confessor, the offender, the stumbler!
I am he who was audacious toward Thee as one insolent! I am he who disobeyed Thee with forethought! I am he who hid myself from Thy servants and blatantly showed myself to Thee! I am he who was awed by Thy servants and felt secure from Thee! I am he who dreaded not Thy penalty and feared not Thy severity! I am the offender against himself! - I am the hostage to his own affliction! I am short in shame! I am long in suffering! By the right of him whom Thou hast distinguished among Thy creation and by him whom Thou hast chosen for Thyself! By the right of him whom Thou hast selected from among Thy creatures and by him whom Thou hast picked for Thy task! By the right of him the obeying of whom Thou hast joined to obeying Thee, and by him the disobeying of whom Thou hast made like disobeying Thee! And by the right of him whose friendship Thou hast bound to Thy friendship and by him whose enmity Thou hast linked to Thine enmity! Shield me in this day of mine, by that through which Thou shieldest him who prays fervently to Thee while disavowing and him who seeks refuge in Thy forgiveness while repenting! Attend to me with that through which Thou attendest to the people of obedience toward Thee, proximity to Thee, and rank with Thee!
Single me out, as Thou singlest him out who fulfils Thy covenant, fatigues himself for Thy sake alone, and exerts himself in Thy good pleasure! Take me not to task for my neglect in respect to Thee, my transgressing the limit in Thy bounds, and stepping outside Thy ordinances! Draw me not on little by little by granting me a respite, like the drawing on little by little of him who withholds from me the good he has by not sharing with Thee in letting favour down upon me! Arouse me from the sleep of the heedless, the slumber of the prodigal, and the dozing of the forsaken! Take my heart to that in which Thou hast employed the devout, enthralled the worshipers, and rescued the remiss! Give me refuge from that which will keep me far from Thee, come between me and my share from Thee, and bar me from that which I strive for in Thee! Make easy for me the road of good deeds toward Thee, racing to them from where Thou hast commanded, and coveting them as Thou desirest!
Efface me not along with those whom Thou effacest for thinking lightly of what Thou hast promised! Destroy me not with those whom Thou destroyest for exposing themselves to Thy hate! Annihilate me not among those whom Thou annihilatest for deviating from Thy roads! Deliver me from the floods of trial, save me from the gullets of affliction, and grant me sanctuary from being seized by respite! Come between me and the enemy who misguides me, the caprice which ruins me, and the failing which overcomes me! Turn not away from me with the turning away in wrath from one with whom Thou art not pleased! Let me not lose heart in expecting from Thee, lest I be overcome by despair of Thy mercy! Grant me not that which I cannot endure, lest Thou weighest me down with the surplus of Thy love which Thou loadest upon me! Send me not from Thy hand, the sending of him who possesses no good, toward whom Thou hast no need, and who turns not back [to Thee]!
Cast me not with the casting of him who has fallen from the eye of Thy regard and been wrapped in degradation from Thee! Rather take my hand [and save me] from the falling of the stumblers, the disquiet of the deviators, the slip of those deluded, and the plight of the perishers! Release me from that with which Thou hast afflicted the ranks of Thy servants and handmaids and make me reach the utmost degrees of him about whom Thou art concerned, towards whom Thou showest favour, and with whom Thou art pleased, so that Thou lettest him live as one praiseworthy and takest him to Thee as one felicitous! Collar me with the collar of abstaining from that which makes good deeds fail and takes away blessings! Impart to my heart restraint before ugly works of evil and disgraceful misdeeds! Divert me not by that which I cannot reach except through Thee from doing that which alone makes Thee pleased with me! Root out from my heart the love of this vile world, which keeps from everything which is with Thee, bars from seeking the mediation to Thee, and distracts from striving for nearness to Thee!
Embellish for me solitude in prayer whispered to Thee by night and by day! Give me a preservation which will bring me close to dread of Thee, cut me off from committing things made unlawful by Thee, and spare me from captivation by dreadful sins! Give me purification from the defilement of disobedience, take away from me the filth of offenses, dress me in the dress of Thy well-being, cloak me in the cloak of Thy release, wrap me in Thy ample favours, and clothe me in Thy bounty and Thy graciousness! Strengthen me with Thy giving success and Thy pointing the right way, help me toward righteous intention, pleasing words, and approved works, and entrust me not to my force and my strength in place of Thy force and Thy strength! Degrade me not on the day Thou raisest me up to meet Thee, disgrace me not before Thy friends, make me not forget remembering Thee, take not away from me thanking Thee, but enjoin it upon me in states of inattention when the ignorant are heedless of Thy boons, and inspire me to laud what Thou hast done for me and confess to what Thou hast conferred upon me! Place my beseeching Thee above the beseeching of the beseechers and my praise of Thee above the praise of the praisers! Abandon me not with my neediness for Thee, destroy me not for what I have done for Thee, and slap not my brow with that with which Thou slappest the brow of those who contend with Thee, for I am submitted to Thee.
I know that the argument is Thine, that Thou art closest to bounty, most accustomed to beneficence, worthy of reverent fear, and worthy of forgiveness, that Thou art closer to pardoning than to punishing, and that Thou art nearer to covering over than to making notorious! Let me live an agreeable life that will tie together what I want and reach what I love while I not bring what Thou dislikest and not commit what Thou hast prohibited; and make me die the death of him whose light runs before him and on his right hand! Abase me before Thyself and exalt me before Thy creatures, lower me when I am alone with Thee and raise me among Thy servants, free me from need for him who has no need of me and increase me in neediness and poverty toward Thee! Give me refuge from the gloating of enemies, the arrival of affliction, lowliness and suffering!
Shield me in what Thou seest from me, the shielding of him who would have power over violence had he no clemency, and would seize for misdeeds had he no lack of haste! When Thou desirest for a people a trial or an evil, deliver me from it, for I seek Thy shelter; and since Thou hast not stood me in the station of disgrace in this world of Thine, stand me not in such a station in the next world of Thine! Couple for me the beginnings of Thy kindnesses with their ends and the ancient of Thy benefits with the freshly risen! Prolong not my term with a prolonging through which my heart will harden! Strike me not with a striking that will take away my radiance! Visit me not with a meanness that will diminish my worth or a deficiency that will keep my rank unknown! Frighten me not with a fright by which I will despair or a terror through which I will dread, but make me stand in awe of Thy threat, take precautions against Thy leaving no excuses and Thy warning, and tremble at the recitation of Thy verses! Fill my night with life by keeping me awake therein for worshipping Thee, solitude with vigil for Thee, exclusive devotion to reliance upon Thee, setting my needs before Thee, and imploring that Thou wilt set my neck free from the Fire and grant me sanctuary from Thy chastisement, within which its inhabitants dwell!
Leave me not blindly wandering in my insolence or inattentive in my perplexity for a time, make me not an admonition to him who takes admonishment, a punishment exemplary for him who takes heed, a trial for him who observes, devise not against me along with those against whom Thou devisest, replace me not with another, change not my name, transform not my body, appoint me not a mockery for Thy creatures, a laughing-stock for Thyself, a follower of anything but Thy good pleasure, a menial servant for anything but avenging Thee! Let me find the coolness of Thy pardon and the sweetness of Thy mercy, Thy repose, Thy ease, and the garden of Thy bliss! Let me taste, through some of Thy boundless plenty, the flavour of being free for what Thou lovest and striving in what brings about proximity with Thee and to Thee, and give me a gift from among Thy gifts! Make my commerce profitable and my return without loss, fill me with fear of Thy station, make me yearn for the meeting with Thee, and allow me to repent with an unswerving repentance along with which Thou lettest no sins remain, small or large, and leavest no wrongs, open or secret! Root out rancour toward the faithful from my breast, bend my heart toward the humble, be toward me as Thou art toward the righteous, adorn me with the adornment of the godfearing, appoint for me a goodly report among those yet to come and a growing remembrance among the later folk, and take me to the plain of those who came first!
Complete the lavishness of Thy favour upon me, clothe me in its repeated generosities, fill my hand with Thy benefits, drive Thy generous gifts to me, make me the neighbour of the best of Thy friends in the Gardens which Thou hast adorned for Thy chosen, and wrap me in Thy noble presents in the stations prepared for Thy beloveds! Appoint for me a resting place with Thee where I may seek haven in serenity, and a resort to which I may revert and rest my eyes, weigh not against me my dreadful misdeeds, destroy me not on the day the secrets are tried, eliminate from me every doubt and uncertainty, appoint for me a way in the truth from every mercy, make plentiful for me the portions of gifts from Thy granting of awards, and fill out for me the shares of beneficence from Thy bestowal of bounty! Make my heart trust in what is with Thee and my concern free for what is Thine, employ me in that in which Thou employest Thy pure friends, drench my heart with Thy obedience when intellects are distracted, and combine within me independence, continence, ease, release, health, plenty, tranquillity, and well being!
Make not fail my good deeds through my disobedience that stains them or my private times of worship through the instigations of Thy trial! Safeguard my face from asking from anyone in the world, and drive me far from begging for that which is with the ungodly! Make me not an aid to the wrongdoers, nor their hand and helper in erasing Thy Book! Defend me whence I know not with a defense through which Thou protectest me! Open toward me the gates of Thy repentance, Thy mercy, Thy clemency, and Thy boundless provision! Surely I am one of those who beseech Thee! And complete Thy favour toward me! Surely Thou art the best of those who show favour! Place the rest of my life in the hajj and the 'umra seeking Thy face, O Lord of the worlds! And may God bless Muhammad and his Household, the good, the pure, and peace be upon him and them always and forever!",(Supplication - 47),sajjadiyya_47.mp3,1,47,روزعرفہ کی دعا,دعای عرفه امام سجاد,47-  دُعَاؤُهُ فِي يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ.,रोज़े अरफ़ा की दुआ - दुआए अरफ़ा,Invocation de ‘Arafa,R,,14.0,144.0,,
48,On the Day of Sacrifice (Idd uz Zuha) and on Friday ,His Supplication on the Day of Sacrifice and on Friday,"O God, this is a blessed and fortunate day, within which the Muslims are gathered in the quarters of Thy earth. Among them are present the asker, the seeker, the beseecher, the fearful, while Thou art looking upon their needs. So I ask Thee by Thy munificence and generosity and easy upon Thee is what I ask Thee! that Thou blessest Muhammad and his Household.
And I ask Thee, O God, our Lord for Thine is the kingdom and Thine is the praise; there is no god but Thou, the Clement, the Generous, the All-loving, the All-kind, Possessor of majesty and munificence, Originator of the heavens and the earth whenever Thou apportionest among Thy faithful servants good, well being, blessing, guidance, works in obedience to Thee, or good through which Thou art kind to them by guiding them to Thee, or raisest them up a degree with Thee, or givest them the good of this world or the next, that Thou givest me amply my share and allotment of it.
And I ask Thee, O God for Thine is the kingdom and the praise; there is no god but Thou that Thou blessest Muhammad, Thy servant and Thy messenger, Thy beloved and Thy selected friend, Thy chosen from among Thy creation, and the Household of Muhammad, the pious, the pure, the chosen, with a blessing no one has strength to count but Thou, that Thou associatest us with the most righteous of Thy faithful servants who supplicate Thee today O Lord of the worlds!— and that Thou forgivest us and them! Surely Thou art powerful over everything. O God, toward Thee I aim with my need and before Thee I set my poverty, my neediness, my misery, for I have more trust in Thy forgiveness and Thy mercy than in my own works.
Thy forgiveness and Thy mercy are vaster than my sins. So bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, and attend to the accomplishment of every need of mine through Thy power over it, its easiness for Thee, my poverty toward Thee, and Thy freedom from need for me! I will come upon no good whatsoever unless through Thee, no one other than Thou will turn any evil away from me, and I have hope in none but Thee for my affair in the next world and in this world. O God, if anyone has ever arranged, made ready, prepared, and drawn himself up to be received by a creature in hope of his support and awards and seeking to attain him and his prize, then today toward Thee, my Master, is my arrangement, my making ready, my preparation, and my drawing up, in hope of Thy pardon and support and in seeking to attain to Thee and Thy prize.
O God, so bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and disappoint not my hope in that today! O He who is not troubled by those who ask and diminished by those who attain their desire! I come not before Thee trusting in a righteous work I have sent ahead, nor in the intercession of any creature in whom I have hope, except the intercession of Muhammad and the Folk of his House (upon him and upon them be Thy peace). I come to Thee admitting sin and evildoing toward myself. I come to Thee hoping for Thy abounding pardon through which Thou hast pardoned the offenders, while their long persistence in dreadful sin did not prevent Thee from returning toward them with mercy and forgiveness! O He whose mercy is wide and whose pardon is abounding! O All-mighty! O All-mighty! O All-generous! O All-generous! Bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, return toward me through Thy mercy, be tender toward me through Thy bounty, and spread out Thy forgiveness upon me!
O God, this station belongs to Thy vicegerents, Thy chosen, while the places of Thy trusted ones in the elevated degree which Thou hast singled out for them have been forcibly stripped! But Thou art the Ordainer of that Thy command is not overcome, the inevitable in Thy governing is not overstepped! However Thou willest and whenever Thou willest! In that which Thou knowest best, Thou art not accused for Thy creation or Thy will! Then Thy selected friends, Thy vicegerents, were overcome, vanquished, forcibly stripped; they see Thy decree replaced, Thy Book discarded, Thy obligations distorted from the aims of Thy laws, and the Sunna of Thy Prophet abandoned!
O God, curse their enemies among those of old and the later folk, and all those pleased with their acts, and their adherents and followers! O God, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad (surely Thou art All-laudable, All-glorious) like Thy blessing, benedictions, and salutations upon Thy chosen Abraham and the people of Abraham! And hasten for them relief, ease, help, strengthening, and confirmation! O God, and make me one of the people who profess Thy Unity, have faith in Thee, and attest to Thy Messenger and the Imams toward whom Thou hast enjoined obedience, and one of those through whom and at whose hands this takes place! Amen, Lord of the worlds!
O God, nothing repels Thy wrath but Thy clemency, nothing repels Thy displeasure but Thy pardon, nothing grants sanctuary from Thy punishment but Thy mercy, and nothing will deliver me from Thee except pleading to Thee before Thee, so bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, and give us on Thy part, my God, relief by means of the power through which Thou bringest the dead servants to life and revivest the dead lands. Destroy me not through gloom, my God, before Thou respondest to me and givest me the knowledge of Thy response to my supplication! Let me taste the flavour of well-being to the end of my term! And let not my enemy gloat over me, place not my neck in his power, and give him not authority over me!
My God, if Thou raisest me up, who is there to push me down? If Thou pushest me down, who is there to raise me up? If Thou honourest me, who is there to humiliate me? If Thou humiliatest me, who is there to honour me? If Thou chastisest me, who is there to have mercy upon me? If Thou destroyest me, who is there to stand up for Thy servant against Thee or ask Thee about his affair? But I know that there is no wrong in Thy decree and no hurry in Thy vengeance. He alone hurries who fears to miss, and only the weak needs to wrong. But Thou art exalted, my God, high indeed above all that!
O God, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, make me not the target of affliction nor the object of Thy vengeance, respite me, comfort me, release me from my stumble, and afflict me not with an affliction in the wake of an affliction, for Thou hast seen my frailty, the paucity of my stratagems, and my pleading to Thee! I seek refuge in Thee today, my God, from Thy wrath, so bless Muhammad and his Household and give me refuge! I seek sanctuary in Thee today from Thy displeasure, so bless Muhammad and his Household, and give me sanctuary! I ask Thee security from Thy chastisement, so bless Muhammad and his Household, and give me security!I seek guidance from Thee, so bless Muhammad and his Household and guide me! I seek help from Thee, so bless Muhammad and his Household and help me! I ask Thee for mercy, so bless Muhammad and his Household and have mercy upon me! I seek sufficiency from Thee, so bless Muhammad and his Household and suffice me! I seek provision from Thee, so bless Muhammad and his Household and provide for me!
I seek assistance from Thee, so bless Muhammad and his Household and assist me! I pray forgiveness for my past sins, so bless Muhammad and his Household and forgive me! I ask Thee to preserve me from sin, so bless Muhammad and his Household and preserve me, for I will not return to anything Thou dislikest from me, if Thou willest that! My Lord! My Lord! O All-loving! O All-kind! O Possessor of majesty and munificence! Bless Muhammad and his Household, and grant me everything that I ask from Thee, seek from Thee, and beseech from Thee! Will it, ordain it, decree it, and accomplish it! Give me good in that of it which Thou decreest! Bless me in that, be gratuitously bountiful toward me through it, make me happy in that of it which Thou givest to me, and increase me in Thy bounty and the plenty of what is with Thee, for Thou art Boundless, Generous! And link that to the good and the bliss of the next world, O Most Merciful of the merciful!
Then you supplicate as seems proper to you and you call down blessings on Muhammad and his Household one thousand times. this is what he used to do (peace be upon him)",(Supplication - 48),sajjadiyya_48.mp3,1,48,عید قربان اور جمعہ کی دعا,دعا برای روز عید قربان و جمعه,48-  دُعَاؤُهُ فِي يَوْمِ الْأَضْحَى والْجُمُعَةِ.,ईद क़ुर्बान और जुमा की दुआ,Fête d’al-Adhâ et du vendredi,R,,14.0,151.0,,
49,In Repelling Enemies,His Supplication in Repelling the Trickery of Enemies and Driving away their Severity,"1- My God, Thou guided me
but I diverted myself,
Thou admonished me but my heart became hardened,
Thou tried me graciously but I disobeyed.
Then, when Thou caused me to know it,
I came to know that from which Thou hadst turned [me] away,
so I prayed forgiveness and Thou released,
and I returned and Thou covered over.
So Thine, my God, is the praise!

2- I plunged into the valleys of destruction
and settled in the ravines of ruin,
exposing myself to Thy chastisements
and the descent of Thy punishments!

3- My mediation with Thee is the profession of Unity,
my way of coming to Thee that I associate nothing with Thee,
nor do I take along with Thee a god;
I have fled to Thee with my soul -
in Thee is the place of flight
for the evildoer,
the place of escape
for him who has squandered the share of his soul
and seeks asylum.

4- How many an enemy has
unsheathed the sword of his enmity toward me,
honed the cutting edge of his knife for me,
sharpened the tip of his blade for me,
mixed his killing potions for me,
pointed toward me his straight-flying arrows,
not allowed the eye of his watchfulness to sleep toward me,
and secretly thought of visiting me with something hateful
and making me gulp down the bitter water of his bile!

5- So Thou looked my God, at
my weakness in bearing oppressive burdens,
my inability to gain victory over him who aims to war against me,
and my being alone before the great numbers
of him who is hostile toward me
and lies in wait for me with an affliction
about which I have not thought.

6- Thou set out at once to help me
and Thou braced up my back!
Thou blunted for me his blade,
made him, after a great multitude, solitary,
raised up my heel over him,
and turned back upon him what he had pointed straight.
So Thou sent him back, his rage not calmed,
his burning thirst not quenched!
Biting his fingers,
he turned his back in flight,
his columns having been of no use.

7- How many an oppressor has oppressed me with his tricks,
set up for me the net of his snares,
appointed over me the inspection of his regard,
and lay in ambush for me,
the lying in ambush of a predator for its game,
waiting to take advantage of its prey,
while he showed me the smile of the flatterer
and looked at me with the intensity of fury!

8- So when Thou saw, my God,
(blessed art Thou and high exalted)
the depravity of his secret thoughts
and the ugliness of what he harboured,
Thou threw him on his head into his own pitfall
and dumped him into the hole of his own digging.
So he was brought down low, after his overbearing, by the nooses of his own snare,
wherein he had thought he would see me;
and what came down upon his courtyard
- had it not been for Thy mercy -
was on the point of coming down upon me!

9- How many an evier has
choked upon me in his agony,
fumed over me in his rage,
cut me with the edge of his tongue,
showed malice toward me by accusing me of his own faults,
made my good repute the target of his shots,
collared me with his own constant defects,
showed malice toward me with his trickery,
and aimed at me with his tricks!

10- So I called upon Thee, my God,
seeking aid from Thee,
trusting in the speed of Thy response,
knowing that
he who seeks haven in the shadow of Thy wing
will not be mistreated,
and he who seeks asylum in the stronghold of
Thy victory will not be frightened.
So Thou fortified me against his severity through Thy power.

11- How many
a cloud of detested things Thou hast dispelled from me,
a cloud of favour Thou hast made rain down upon me,
a stream of mercy Thou hast let flow,
a well-being in which Thou hast clothed me,
an eye of mishap Thou hast blinded,
and a wrap of distress Thou hast removed!

12- How many
a good opinion Thou hast verified,
a destitution Thou hast redressed,
an infirmity Thou hast restored to health,
and a misery Thou hast transformed!

13- All of that was favour and graciousness from Thee,
and in all of it I was occupied
with acts of disobeying Thee.
My evildoing did not hinder Thee
from completing Thy beneficence,
nor was I stopped
from committing acts displeasing to Thee.
Thou art not questioned as to what Thou dost!1

14- Thou wert asked, and Thou bestowed.
Thou wert not asked, and Thou began.
Thy bounty was requested,
and Thou didst not skimp.
Thou refused, my Master, everything but
beneficence, kindness, graciousness, and favour,
and I refused everything but plunging into what Thou hast made unlawful,
transgressing Thy bounds,
and paying no heed to Thy threat!
So Thine is the praise, my God,
the All-powerful who is not overcome,
and the Possessor of patient waiting who does not hurry!

15- This is the station of one who confesses to lavishness of favours,
counters them with shortcomings,
and bears witness to his own negligence.

16- O God,
so I seek nearness to Thee through
the elevated rank of Muhammad
and the radiant degree of 'Ali,
and I turn to Thee through them
so that Thou wilt give me refuge
from the evil of [so and so],2
for that will not constrain Thee in Thy wealth,
nor trouble Thee in Thy power,
and Thou art powerful over everything!3

17- So give me, my God,
by Thy mercy and Thy lasting bestowal of success,
that which I may take as a ladder
with which to climb to Thy good pleasure
and be secure from Thy punishment,

50,In Fear,His Supplication in Fear,"1- O God,
Thou created me without fault,
nurtured me when small,
and provided me with sufficiency.

2- O God,
I found in the Book which Thou sent down
and through which Thou gave good news to Thy servants,
that Thou said,
O My servants who hare been prodigal against yourselves,
do not despair of God's mercy,
surely God forgives all sins,1
but there has gone ahead from me what Thou knowest
(and of which Thou knowest more than I)!
O the shame of what Thy Book has counted against me!2

3- Were it not for the places
where I expectantly hope for Thy pardon,
which enfolds all things,
I would have thrown myself down [in despair]!
Were anyone able to flee from his Lord,
I would be the most obligated to flee from Thee!
But not a secret in earth and heaven is concealed from Thee,
except that Thou bringest it.3
Thou sufficest as a recompenser!
Thou sufficest as a reckoner!4

4- O God,
surely Thou wouldst seek me if I flee
and catch me if I run.
So here I am before Thee,
abject, lowly, abased.
If Thou chastisest me,
I am worthy of that,
and it would be, my Lord, an act of justice from Thee.
But if Thou pardonest me,
anciently has Thy pardon enfolded me
and Thy well-being garmented me!

5- So I ask Thee, O God,
by Thy names stored in Thy treasury5
and Thy splendour masked by the veils!
If Thou hast no mercy upon this anxious soul
and these uneasy, decaying bones -
he cannot endure the heat of Thy sun,
so how can he endure the heat of Thy Fire?
He cannot endure the sound of Thy thunder,
so how can he endure the sound of Thy wrath?

6- So have mercy upon me, O God,
for I am a vile man
and my worth is little.
Chastising me will not add the weight of a dust mote to Thy kingdom.
Were chastising me something that would add to Thy kingdom,
I would ask Thee for patience to bear it
and would love for it to belong to Thee;
but Thy authority, my God, is mightier,
and Thy kingdom more lasting, than that the obedience of the obeyers should increase it
or the disobedience of the sinners diminish it!

7- So have mercy upon me,
O Most Merciful of the merciful!
Show me forbearance,
O Possessor of majesty and munificence!
And turn toward me,
Surely Thou art Ever-turning, All-compassionate!",(Supplication - 50),sajjadiyya_50.mp3,1,50,خوف الہی کے سلسلے میں دعا,دعا در مقام ترس از خدا,50-  دُعَاؤُهُ فِي الرَّهْبَةِ.,ख़ौफ़ इलाही के सिलसिले में दुआ,Craindre le châtiment de Dieu,D,,,,,
51,In Pleading and Abasement,His Supplication in Pleading and Abasement,"1- My God,
I praise Thee,
- and Thou art worthy of praise -
for Thy benefaction toward me,
the lavishness of Thy favours toward me,
and Thy plentiful bestowal upon me,
and for showing bounty toward me through Thy mercy
and lavishing Thy favour upon me.
Thou hast done well toward me
and I am incapable of thanking Thee.

2- Were it not for Thy beneficence toward me
and the lavishness of Thy favours upon me,
I would not have reached the taking of my share
nor would my soul have been set right,
but Thou began with beneficence toward me,
provided me sufficiency in all my affairs,
turned away from me the toil of affliction,
and held back from me the feared decree.

3- My God,
how many a toilsome affliction
which Thou hast turned away from me!
How many a lavish favour
with which Thou hast gladdened my eye!
How many a generous benefaction of Thine
which is present with me!

4- It is Thou who
responded to my supplication at the time of distress,
released me from my slip in stumbling,
and took my enemies to task for doing wrong to me.

5- My God,
I did not find Thee a miser when I asked of Thee
nor a withholder when I desired from Thee.
No, 1 found Thee a hearer of my supplication
and a bestower of my requests;
I found Thy favours toward me lavish in my every situation
and in my every time.
So Thou art praised by me and Thy benefaction honoured.

6- My soul, my tongue, and my intelligence praise Thee,
a praise that reaches fulfilment and the reality of thanksgiving,
a praise that attains to Thy good pleasure with me -
so deliver me from Thy displeasure!

7- O my cave when the ways thwart me!
O He who releases me from my stumble!
Were it not for Thy covering my shameful defects, I would be one of the disgraced.
O my confirmer through help!
Were it not for Thy helping me,
I would be one of the overcome!
O He before whom kings place the yoke of lowliness around their necks,
fearing His penalties!
O worthy of reverent fear!
O He to whom belong the names most beautiful!1
I ask Thee to pardon me and to forgive me,
for I am not innocent
that I should offer excuses,
nor a possessor of strength
that I should gain victory,
nor have I any place of flight that I should flee!

8- I ask Thee to release me from my stumbles,
and before Thee I disavow my sins,
which have laid me waste,
encompassed me, and destroyed me!
I flee from them to Thee, my Lord,
turning repentantly, so turn toward me,
seeking refuge, so grant me refuge,
asking sanctuary, so abandon me not,
requesting, so deprive me not,
holding fast, so leave me not,
supplicating, so send me not back disappointed!

9- I have supplicated Thee, my Lord, as one
miserable, abased,
apprehensive, fearful,
quaking, poor,
driven to have recourse to Thee!

10- I complain to Thee, my God,
of my soul - which is too weak
to hurry to that which Thou hast promised Thy friends
or to avoid
that against which Thou hast cautioned Thy enemies -
and of the multitude of my concerns,
and of my soul's confusing thoughts.

11- My God,
Thou hast not disgraced me through my secret thoughts
or destroyed me because of my misdeeds!
I call upon Thee, and Thou respondest,
even if I am slow when Thou callest upon me.
I ask Thee everything I want of my needs,
and I deposit with Thee my secret
wherever I may be.
I supplicate no one besides Thee,
and I hope for no one other than Thee.

12- At Thy service! At Thy service!
Thou hearest him who complains to Thee!
Thou receivest him who has confidence in Thee!
Thou savest him who holds fast to Thee!
Thou givest relief to him who seeks shelter in Thee!

13- My God,
so deprive me not of the good
of the last world and the first
because of the paucity of my thanksgiving
and forgive me the sins of mine which Thou knowest!

14- If Thou chastisest,
I am the wrongdoer, the neglecter,
the negligent, the sinner,
the derelict, the sluggard,
the heedless of the share of my soul!
And if Thou forgivest -
Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful!",(Supplication - 51),sajjadiyya_51.mp3,1,51,عجز و زاری کے سلسلہ میں دعا,دعا برای تضرّع و زاری به درگاه خداوند,51-  دُعَاؤُهُ فِي التَّضَرُّعِ والِاسْتِكَانَةِ.,अल्लाह की सिफ़ारिश और बे'ईज़ज़ती से बचने की दुआ,Modestie à l’égard de Dieu,D,,,,,
52,In Imploring God,His Supplication in Imploring God,"1- O God, from whom nothing is concealed in earth or heaven!
How should what Thou hast created, my God,
be concealed from Thee?
How shouldst Thou not number
what Thou hast made?
How should what Thou governest
be absent from Thee?
How should one who has no life except through Thy provision have the ability to flee from Thee?
How should one who has no road except in Thy kingdom escape from Thee?

2- Glory be to Thee!
He among Thy creatures who fears Thee most
knows Thee best,1
he among them most bent in humility
is most active in obeying Thee,
and he among them whom Thou providest while he worships another is most contemptible before Thee!

3- Glory be to Thee!
He who associates others with Thee and denies Thy messengers
diminishes not Thy authority.
He who dislikes Thy decree
cannot reject Thy command.
He who denies Thy power
keeps himself not away from Thee.
He who worships other than Thee
escapes Thee not.
He who dislikes meeting Thee
will not be given endless life in this world.

4. Glory be to Thee!
How mighty is Thy station,
overpowering Thy authority,
intense Thy strength,
penetrating Thy command!

5. Glory be to Thee!
Thou hast decreed death for all Thy creatures,
both him who professes Thy Unity
and him who disbelieves in Thee;
each one will taste death,2
each one will come home to Thee.
Blessed art Thou and high exalted!
There is no god but Thou, Thou alone,
who hast no associate.

6. I have faith in Thee,
I attest to Thy messengers,
I accept Thy Book,
I disbelieve in every object of worship other than Thee,
I am quit of anyone who worships another!

7. O God,
I rise in the morning and enter the evening
making little of my good works,
confessing my sins,
admitting my offenses;
I am abased because of my prodigality against myself.
My works have destroyed me,
my caprice has ruined me,
my passions have deprived me.

8- So I ask Thee, my Master,
the asking of him
whose soul is diverted by his drawn out expectations,
whose body is heedless because of the stillness of his veins,3
whose heart is entranced
by the multitude of favours done for him,
whose reflection is little
concerning that to which he is coming home;

9- the asking of him whom
false expectation has overcome,
caprice has entranced,
and this world has mastered,
and over whom death has cast its shadow;
the asking of him who
makes much of his sins
and confesses his offense;
the asking of him who has
no Lord but Thou,
no friend besides Thee,
no one to deliver him from Thee,
and no asylum from Thee except in Thee.4

10- My God, I ask Thee
by Thy right incumbent upon all Thy creatures,
by Thy mighty name
with which Thou commanded Thy messenger to glorify Thee,
and by the majesty of Thy generous face,
which ages not, nor changes,
nor alters, nor passes away,
that Thou blessest Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,
that Thou freest me from need for all things
through worshipping Thee,
that Thou distractest my soul from this world
through fear of Thee,
and that Thou turnest me back toward Thy abundant generosity through Thy mercy!

11- To Thee I flee,
Thee I fear,
from Thee I seek aid,
in Thee I hope,
Thee I supplicate,
in Thee I seek asylum,
in Thee I trust,
from Thee I ask help,
in Thee I have faith,

53,In Abasing himself,His Supplication in Abasing himself before God (Mighty and Majestic is He),"1- My Lord, my sins have silenced me,
and my words have been cut off.
I have no argument,
for I am the prisoner of my own affliction,
the hostage to my works,
the frequenter of my own offense,
the confused in my intended way,
the thwarted.

2- I have brought myself to a halt in the halting place of the abased sinners,
the halting place of the wretched and insolent,
those who think lightly of Thy promise.

3- Glory be to Thee! What insolence I have insolently shown toward Thee!
What delusion with which I have deluded myself!

4- My Master, have mercy on my falling flat on my face, the slipping of my foot,
grant me
my ignorance through Thy clemency,
and my evildoing through Thy beneficence,

the depletion of my days,
the nearing of my term,

Here you should recite the throne verse (2:255), the two Suras of taking refuge (113-114), and unity (112). Then say:

with the asking of him whose neediness is intense,
whose strength is frail,
whose sins are many,
the asking of one who finds no helper in his neediness,
no strengthener in his frailty,
no forgiver of his sin other than Thee,

I ask of Thee a work through which Thou wilt love him who works it
and a certainty by which Thou wilt profit him who is certain

4- O God,
bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,
take my soul while it is firm in sincerity,
cut off my need for this world,
make my desire for what is with Thee
become a yearning to meet Thee,
and give me true confidence in Thee!

5- I ask of Thee the good of the writ that has been made
and I seek refuge with Thee from the evil of the writ that has been made.2
I ask of Thee
the fear of The worshipers,
the worship of those humbly fearful of Thee,
the certainty of those who have confidence in Thee,
and the confidence of those who have faith in Thee.

6- O God, make my desire in my asking
like the desire of Thy friends in their asking,
and my fear
like the fear of Thy friends!
Employ me in Thy good pleasure through works
in which I will not leave aside anything of Thy religion
fearing any of Thy creatures!

7- O God,
this is my need,
so make my desire for it great,
within it make manifest my excuse,
through it instil me with my argument,
and by means of it make well my body!

some rise in the morning
having trust or hope in other than Thee.
I rise in the morning,
and Thou art my trust and my hope in all affairs,
