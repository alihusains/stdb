1,Dua Mashlool,"This du-a'a known as ""supplication of the youth stricken for his sin,"" is quoted from the work of Kaf-ami and from Muhaj al Da-wat by Sayyid ibn tawus. Through Imam Hussain(as) it is reported that one day he and his father, after performing Hajj, caught sight of a paralysed young man crying his eyes out in repentance. They went near to console him and find out the reason of his sorry plight. He was a habitual sinner, always teased his father, disobeyed him and treated him with contempt. One day, disgusted, the father invoked curse upon him. So he was affected with paralysis. Then and there Imam Ali ibn abi Talib(as) wrote his dua'a and gave it to him with instruction to recite after Isha salat. Next day fully cured, he came to Imam Ali and said that he had recited the dua'a as told and went to sleep. He saw the Holy prophet(sa) in the dream. The holy prophet, gently touched his body with his hand and asked him to remember this dua'a as it contain ismi azam (the great name of Allah).Recite this dua'a after Isha salat. It brings countless blessings. All your legitimate desires will be fulfilled. It drives away poverty and sickness. Sins are for given. Debts are cleared. Enemies become friends. Domestic affairs are set aright. Disputes are settled in your favour. Prisoners are set free mental worries disappear. Prosperity, sound mind and healthy body stand by you at all times.Mercy and forgiveness of sins are the main advantages the almighty Allah makes available if this dua'a is recited regularly.

""Verily Allah is the Honored, the Wise""; And I beseech Thee with the help of Thy Beautiful Names which Thou has praised in Thy Book, saying,:Unto Allah belong the beautiful names -- so call ye Him by Them; And Thou hast said ""Call unto Me and I shall answer you; and Thou has said, 
""And when My servants ask something of Me, lo, I am near, and I grant the prayer of the supplicant when he asks anything of Me, so pray ye unto Me and believe in Me, that ye may be made perfect; And Thou has said, ""O My servants who have wronged yourselves, despair not of the Mercy of Allah; verilly Allah forgiveth all the sins; verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."" 
Therefore I pray unto Thee, My God, and I ask Thee, My Cherisher and Sustainer, and I hope from Thee, my Chief, and I crave Thy acceptance of my prayer, O my Protector, even as Thou hast promised me, and I call upon Thee even as Thou hast commanded me -- 
So, do unto me what pleases Thee to do, O Generous One! (Here the Devotee should pray for the fulfillment of his valid desires.)

2,Dua Sabah,at Early Morning - as taught by  Imam Ali ibne Abi Talib (as),"In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful
Oh God, Oh He who extended the morning's tongue in the speech of its dawning, dispatched the fragments of the dark night into the gloom of its stammering, made firm the structure of the turning spheres in the measures of its display and beamed forth the brightness of the sun through the light of its blazing! Oh He who demonstrates His Essence by His Essence, transcends congeneity with His creatures and is exalted beyond conformity with His qualities!  
Oh He who is near to the passing thoughts of opinions, far from the regards of eyes and knows what will be before it comes to be! Oh He who has put me at ease in the cradle of His security and sanctuary, awakened me to the favors and kindness that He has bestowed upon me and held from the claws of evil with His hand and His force!  
Bless, oh God, the guide to Thee in the darkest night, him who, of Thy ropes, clings to the cord of the longest nobility, him whose glory is evident at the summit of stout shoulders and whose feet were entrenched in spite of slippery places in ancient time; and [bless] his household, the good, the chosen, the pious,  
And open for us, oh God, the leaves of morning's door with the keys of mercy and prosperity! Clothe me, oh God, with the most excellent robes of guidance and righteousness!  
Plant, oh God, through Thy tremendousness, the springs of humility in the watering place of my heart! Cause to flow, oh God, because of Thy awesomeness, tears of moaning from the corner of my eyes! And chastise, oh God, the recklessness of my clumsiness with the reins of contentment! My God, if mercy from Thee does not begin with fair success for me, then who can take me to Thee upon the evident path?  
If Thy deliberateness would turn me over to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips from the stumbles of caprice? If Thy deliberateness should turn me over to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips from the stumbles of caprice? If Thy help should forsake me in the battle with the soul and Satan, then Thy forsaking will have entrusted me to where there is hardship and deprivation. My God, dost Thou see that I have only come to Thee from the direction of hopes or clung to the ends of Thy cords when my sins have driven me from the house of union?  
So what an evil mount upon which my soul has mounted - its caprice! Woe upon it for being seduced by its own opinions and wishes! And destruction be upon it for its audacity toward its Master and Protector! My God, I have knocked upon the door of Thy mercy with the hand of my hope, fled to Thee seeking refuge from my excessive caprice and fixed the fingers of my love to the ends of Thy cords.  
So pardon, oh God, the slips and errors I have committed and release me from the foot-tangling of my robe. For Thou art my Master, my Protector, my Support and my Hope and Thou art the object of my search and my desire in my ultimate end and stable abode. My God, how couldst Thou drive away a poor beggar who seeks refuge in Thee from sins, fleeing? Or how couldst Thou disappoint one seeking guidance who repairs to Thy threshold, running?  
Never! For Thy pools are full in the hardship of drought, Thy door is open for seeking and penetration and Thou art the goal of requests and the object of hopes. My God, these are the reins of my soul I have bound them with the ties of Thy will. These are the burdens of my sins I have averted them with Thy pardon and mercy. And these are my caprices that lead astray - I have entrusted them to the threshold of Thy gentleness and kindliness.  
So make this morning of mine, oh God, descend upon me with the radiance of guidance, and with safety in religion and this world! And [make] my evening a shield against the deception of enemies and a protection against the destructive blows of caprice!  
Verily Thou art able over what Thou wilt! Thou givest the kingdom to whom Thou wilt, and Thou seizest the kingdom from whom Thou wilt; Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt; in Thy hand is the good; Thou art powerful over all things. Thou makest the night to enter into the day, and Thou makest the day to enter into the night; Thou bringest forth the living from the dead, and Thou bringest forth dead from the living; and Thou providest whomsoever Thou wilt without reckoning.  
There is no god but Thou! Glory be to Thee, oh God, and Thine is the praise! Who knows Thy measure without fearing Thee? Who knows what Thou art without awe of Thee? Through Thy power Thou hast joined disparate things, through Thy gentleness Thou hast cleaved apart the daybreak and through Thy generosity Thou hast illumined the dark shrouds of night. Thou hast made waters, sweet and salt, flow forth from hard shining stones, sent down out of rain-clouds water cascading and appointed the sun and moon a blazing lamp for the creatures, without experiencing in that which Thou originated either weariness or effort.  
So, oh He who is alone in might and subsistence and dominates His slaves with death and annihilation, Bless Muhammad and his household, the godfearing, answer my supplication hear my call, destroy my enemies and actualize through Thy bounty my hope and desire.  
Oh best of those who is called to remove affliction and object of hope in every difficulty and ease! I have stated my need, so do not reject me, oh my master, despairing of Thy exalted gifts. Oh All-generous! Oh All-generous! Oh All-generous! By Thy mercy, oh Most Merciful of the merciful! And God bless the best of His creatures, Muhammad, and all his household!  
Then he should prostrate and say: 
My God, my heart is veiled, my soul deficient, my intelligence defeated, my caprice triumphant, my obedience little, my disobedience much and my tongue acknowledges sins. So what am I to do? Oh He who covers defects! Oh He who knows the unseen things! Forgive my sins, all of them, by the sacredness of Muhammad and the household of Muhammad! Oh All-forgiver! Oh All-forgiver! Oh All-forgiver! By Thy mercy, oh Most Merciful of the merciful!",,دعاء صباح,دعای صباح,دعاء الصباح,दुआ सबह,Dua Sabah,sabah.mp3,,urdu_sabah,7.0
3,Dua Kumayl,"ORIGIN OF THE DU'A Kumayl Ibn Ziyad Nakha'i was a confidant amongst the companions of  Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib (as.) and this sublime Du'a was first heard from the beautiful, though anguished, voice of Imam Ali.

According to Allama Majlisi (on whom be Allah's Mercy) Kumayl had attended an assembly in the Mosque at Basra which was addressed by Imam Ali in the course of which the night of the 15th of Shaban was mentioned. Imam Ali said-""Whosoever keeps awake in devoutness on this night and recites the Du'a of Prophet Khizr, undoubtedly that person's supplication will be responded to and granted. When the assembly at the Mosque had dispersed, Kumayl called at the house where Imam Ali was staying, and requested him to acquaint him with Prophet Khizr's ""Du'a"". Imam Ali asked Kumayl to sit down, record and memorise the ""Du'a"" which Imam Ali dictated to Kumayl.

Imam Ali then advised Kumayl to recite this ""Du'a"" on the eve of (i.e. evening preceding) every Friday, or once a month or at least once in every year so that, added Imam Ali, ""Allah may protect thee from the evils of the enemies and the plots contrived by impostors. O' Kumayl! in consideration of thy companionship and understanding, I grant thee this honour of entrusting this ""Du'a"" to thee.""","O Allah! Bless Muhammad and his progeny. 
O Allah! I beseech Thee by Thy mercy which encompasses all things And by Thy power by which Thou overcometh all things and submit to it all things and humble before it all things And by Thy might by which Thou hast conquered all things And by Thy majesty against which nothing can stand up 
And by Thy grandeur which prevails upon all things And by Thy authority which is exercised over all things And by Thy own self that shall endure forever after all things have vanished And by Thy Names which manifest Thy power over all things And by Thy knowledge which pervades all things And by the light of Thy countenance which illuminates everything O Thou who art the light! 
O Thou who art the most holy! O Thou who existed before the foremost! O Thou who shall exist after the last! 
O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would affront my continency O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would bring down calamity 
O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would change divine favours (into disfavours (O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would hinder my supplication O Allah! Forgive me such sins as bring down misfortunes (or afflictions) O Allah! Forgive my such sins as would suppress hope 
O Allah! Forgive every sin that I have committed and every error that I have erred O Allah! I endeavour to draw myself nigh to Thee through Thy invocation And I pray to Thee to intercede on my behalf And I entreat Thee by Thy benevolence to draw me nearer to Thee And grant me that I should be grateful to Thee and inspire me to remember and to invoke Thee 
O Allah! I entreat Thee begging Thee submissively, humbly and awestrickenly To treat me with clemency and mercy, and to make me pleased and contented with what Thou hast allotted to me And cause me to be modest and unassuming in all circumstances 
O Allah! I beg Thee as one who is passing through extreme privation and who supplicates his needs to Thee and his hope has been greatly raised by that which is with Thee 
O Allah! Great is Thy kingdom and exalted is Thy greatness Thy plan is secret, Thy authority is manifest, Thy might is victorious and subduing and Thy power is prevalent throughout and it is not possible to escape from Thy dominion 
O Allah! Except Thee I do not find any one able to pardon my sins nor to conceal my loathsome acts Nor have I any one except Thee to change my evil deeds into virtues There is no god but Thou glory and praise be to Thee I have made my own soul to suffer I had the audacity (to sin) by my ignorance Relying upon my past remembrance of Thee and Thy grace towards me 
O Allah! My Lord! How many of my loathsome acts hast Thou screened (from public gaze) How many of my grievous afflictions (distresses) hast Thou reduced in severity And how many of my stumblings hast Thou protected, how many of my detestable acts has Thou averted, and how many of my undeserving praises hast Thou spread abroad! 
O Allah! My trials and sufferings have increased and my evilness has worsened, my good deeds have diminished and my yokes (of misdeeds) have become firm And remote hopes restrain me to profit (by good deeds) and the world has deceived me with its allurements and my own self has been affected by treachery and procrastination 
Therefore, my Lord! I implore Thee by Thy greatness not to let my sins and my misdeeds shut out access to my prayers from reaching Thy realm and not to disgrace me by exposing those (hidden ones) of which Thou hast knowledge nor to hasten my retribution for those vices and misdeeds committed by me in secret which were due to evil mindedness, ignorance, excessive lustfulness and my negligence 
O Allah! I beg Thee by Thy greatness to be compassionate to me in all circumstances and well disposed towards me in all matters My God! My Nourisher! Have I anyone except Thee from whom I can seek the dislodging of my evils and understanding of my problems? 
My God! My Master! Thou decreed a law for me but instead I obeyed my own low desires And I did not guard myself against the allurements of my enemy He deceived me with vain hopes whereby I was led astray and fate helped him in that respect Thus I transgressed some of its limits set for me by Thee and I disobeyed some of Thy commandments; 
Thou hast therefore a (just) cause against me in all those matters and I have no plea against Thy judgement passed against me I have therefore become (justifiably) liable to Thy judgement and afflictions 
But now I have turned Thee, my Lord, after being guilty of omissions and transgressions against my soul, apologetically, repentantly, broken heartedly, entreating earnestly for forgiveness, yieldingly confessing (to my guilt) as I can find no escape from that which was done by me and having no refuge to which I could turn except seeking Thy acceptance of my excuse and admitting me into the realm of Thy capacious mercy 
O Allah! Accept my apology and have pity on my intense sufferings and set me free from my heavy fetters (of evil deeds) My Nourisher! Have mercy on the infirmity of my body, the delicacy of my skin and the brittleness of my bones O' Thou! 
Who originated my creation and (accorded me) my individuality, and (ensured) my upbringing and welfare (and provided) my sustenance (I beg Thee) to restore Thy favours and blessings upon me as Thou didst in the beginning of my life 
O' my God! My master! My Lord! And my Nourisher! What! Wilt Thou see me punished with the fire kindled by Thee despite my belief in Thy unity? 
And despite the fact that my heart has been filled with (pure) knowledge of Thee and when my tongue has repeatedly praised Thee and my conscience has acknowledged Thy love and despite my sincere confessions (of my sins) and my humble entreaties submissively made to Thy divinity? 
Nay, Thou art far too kind and generous to destroy one whom thyself nourished and supported, or to drive away from Thyself one whom Thou has kept under Thy protection, or to scare away one whom Thy self hast given shelter, or to abandon in affliction one Thou hast maintained and to whom Thou hast been merciful 
I wish I had known o' my Master, my God and my Lord! Wilt Thou inflict fire upon faces which have submissively bowed in prostration to Thy greatness, or upon the tongues which have sincerely confirmed Thy unity and have always expressed gratitude to Thee, or upon hearts which have acknowledged Thy divinity with conviction, or upon the minds which accumulated so much knowledge of Thee until they became submissive to Thee, or upon the limbs which strove, at the places appointed for Thy worship, to adore Thee willingly and seek Thy forgiveness submissively? 
Such sort (of harshness) is not expected from Thee as it is remote from Thy grace, o' generous one! O' Lord! Thou art aware of my weakness to bear even a minor affliction of this world and its consequence and adversity affecting the denizen of this earth, although such afflictions are momentary, short-lived and transient 
How then can I bear the retributions and the punishments of the hereafter which are enormous and of intensive sufferings, of prolonged period and perpetual duration, and which shall never be alleviated for those who deserve the same as those retributions will be the result of Thy wrath; and Thy punishment which neither the heavens nor the earth can withstand and bear! My Lord! 
How can I, a weak, insignificant, humble, poor and destitute creature of Thine be able to bear them? 
O' my God! My Lord! My King! And Master! Which of the matters shall I complain to Thee and for which of them shall I bewail and weep? shall I bewail for the pains and pangs of the punishment and their intensity or for the length of sufferings and their duration? 
Therefore (my Lord!) If Thou wilt subject me to the penalties (of hell) in company of Thy enemies and cast me with those who merited Thy punishments and tear me apart from Thy friends and those who will be near to Thee, then my God, my Lord and my Master, though I may patiently bear Thy punishments, how can I calmly accept being kept away from Thee? 
I reckon that though I may patiently endure the scorching fire of Thy hell, yet how can I resign myself to the denial of Thy pity and clemency? How can I remain in the fire while I have hopes of Thy forgiveness? 
O' my Lord! By Thy honour truly do I swear that, if Thou wilt allow my power of speech to be retained by me in the hell, I shall amongst its inmates cry out bewailingly unto Thee like the cry of those who have faith in Thy kindness and compassion And I shall bemoan for Thee (for being deprived of nearness to Thee) the lamentation of those who are bereaved, and I shall keep on calling unto Thee: ""Where art Thou o' Friend of the believers! O' (Thou who art) the last hope and resort of those who acknowledge Thee and have faith in Thy clemency and kindness; o' Thou who art the helper of those seeking help! O' Thou who art dear to the hearts of those who truly believe in Thee! And o' Thou who art the Lord of the universe."" 
My Lord! Glory and praise be to Thee, wouldst Thou (wish) to be seen (disregarding) the voice of a muslim bondman, incarcerated therein (the hell) for his disobedience and imprisoned within its pits for his evildoings and misdeeds, crying out to Thee the utterance of one who has faith in Thy mercy and calling out to Thee in the language of those who believe in Thy unity and seeking to approach Thee by means of Thy epithet ""the Creator, the Nourisher, the Accomplisher and the Protector of the entire existence""? 
My Lord! Then how could he remain in torments when he hopefully relies upon Thy past forbearance, compassion and mercy? 
And how can the fire cause him suffering when he hopes for Thy grace and mercy and how can its roaring flames char him when Thou hearest his voice and sees his plight? And how can he withstand its roaring flames when Thou knowest his fraility? And how can he be tossed about between its layers when Thou knowest his sincerity? 
And how can the guards of hell threaten him when he calls out to Thee? ""My Lord"", and how would Thou abandon him therein (the hell) when he has faith in Thy grace to set him free? 
Alas! That is not the concept (held by us) of Thee nor has Thy grace such a reputation nor does it resemble that which Thou hast awarded by Thy kindness and generosity to those who believe in Thy unity I definitely conclude that hadst Thou not ordained punishment for those who disbelieved in Thee, and hadst Thou not decreed Thy enemies to remain in hell, 
Thou wouldst have made the hell cold and peaceful and there would never have been an abode or place for any one in it; but sanctified be Thy Names, Thou hast sworn to fill the hell with the disbelievers from amongst the jinns and mankind together and to place forever Thy enemies therein 
And Thou, exalted be Thy praises, hadst made manifest, out of Thy generosity and kindness, that a believer is not like unto him who is an evil-liver. 
My Lord! My Master! I, therefore implore Thee by that power which Thou determineth and by the decree which Thou hast finalised and ordained whereby Thou hath prevailed upon whom 
Thou hast imposed it, to bestow upon me this night and this very hour the forgiveness for all the transgressions that I have been guilty of, for all the sins that I have committed, for all the loathsome acts that I have kept secret and for all the evils done by me, secretly or openly, in concealment or outwardly and for every evil action that Thou hast ordered the two noble scribes to confirm whom Thou hast appointed to record all my actions and to be witnesses over me along with the limbs of my body, whilst Thou observeth over me besides them and wast witness to those acts concealed from them? 
Which Thou in Thy mercy hast kept secret and through Thy kindness unexposed and I pray to Thee to make my share plentiful in all the good that Thou dost bestow; in all the favours that Thou dost grant; and in all the virtues that Thou dost allow to be known everywhere; and in all the sustenance and livelihood that Thou dost expand and in respect of all the sins that Thou dost forgive and the wrongs that Thou dost cover up O' Lord! O' Lord! O' Lord! 
O' my God! My Lord! My King! O' Master of my freedom! O' Thou who holdeth my destiny and who art aware of my suffering and poverty, 
O' Thou who knoweth my destitution and starvation, o' my Lord! O' Lord, o' Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy glory and Thy honour, by Thy supremely high attributes and by Thy names to cause me to utilise my time, day and night, in Thy remembrance, by engaging myself in serving Thee (Thy cause) and to let my deeds be such as to be acceptable to Thee, so much so that all my actions and offerings (prayers) may be transformed into one continuous and sustained effort and my life may take the form of constant and perpetual service to Thee 
O' my Master! O' Thou upon Whom I rely! O' Thou unto Whom I express my distress! 
O' my Lord! My Lord! My Lord! Strengthen my limbs for Thy service and sustain the strength of my hands to persevere in Thy service and bestow upon me the eagerness to fear Thee and constantly to serve Thee 
So that I may lead myself towards Thee in the field with the vanguards who are in the fore rank and be swift towards Thee among those who hasten towards Thee and urge eagerly to be near Thee and draw myself towards Thee like them who sincerely draw themselves towards Thee and to fear Thee like the fear of those who believe firmly in Thee and thus I may join the congregation of the faithful congregated near Thee (for protection) 
O' Allah! Whosoever intendeth evil against me, let ill befall on him and frustrate him who plots against me and assign for me a place in Thy presence with the best of Thy bondsmen and nearer abode to Thee, for verily that position cannot be attained except through Thy grace and treat me benevolently, and through Thy greatness extend 
Thy munificence towards me and through Thy mercy protect me and cause my tongue to accentuate Thy remembrance and my heart filled with Thy love and be liberal to me by Thy gracious response and cause my evils to appear fewer and forgive me my errors. 
For verily, Thou hast ordained for Thy bondsmen Thy worship and bidden them to supplicate unto Thee and hast assured them (of Thy) response 
So, my Lord! I look earnestly towards Thee and towards Thee, my Lord! I have stretched forth my hands therefore, by Thy honour, respond to my supplication and let me attain my wishes and, by Thy bounty, frustrate not my hopes and protect me from the evils of my enemies, from among the jinns and mankind o' Thou! Who readily pleased, forgive one who owns nothing but supplication for Thou doest what Thou willest o' Thou! 
Whose Name is the remedy (for all ills) and Whose remembrance is a sure cure for all ailments and obedience to Whom makes one self sufficient; have mercy on one whose only asset is hope and whose only armour is lamentation O' Thou! Who perfecteth all bounties and Who wardeth off all misfortunes! 
O' Light! Who illuminateth those who are in bewilderment! O' Omniscient! Who knoweth without (acquisition of) learning! Bless Mohammed and the Descendants of Mohammed and do unto me in accordance with that which befitteth Thee, 
and deal with me not in accordance to my worth May the blessings of Allah be bestowed upon His Apostle and the Rightful Imams from his Descendants and His peace be upon them plentifully",,دعائے کمیل بن زیاد,دعای کمیل,دُعَاء كُميل بن زياد,दुआ कुमैल,Dua Kumayl,kumayl.mp3,,urdu_kumail,16.0
4,Dua Nudba ,To be recited on Fridays after sunrise in lamentation & other occasions ,"Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. And blessings of Allah and peace be on our Chief Muhammad, His Prophet, and on his children. O my Allah! (All) praise is for Thee for that which Thou decided upon and resolved in the matter of Thy friends, whom Thou purified for Thyself and Thy religion. When wisdom and high rank from Thee, prostrated themselves in adoration before them (from the Bountiful Preserving Lord), for whom neither there was any decreased, nor dispersion thereafter, then Thou stipulated for them piety and righteousness. While they were in this mean and crooked world, free from its pomp, vanity and false enjoyments, Thy overreaching authority made known their identity; and equipped them with sincerity and perfection stood surety for them and communicated intimately with them, sent the news of their auspicious arrival in advance, and praised them in clear terms for the benefit of one and all. 
Fell down on the ground in prostration Thy Angels before them, Thou chose them to reveal Thy Words, gave them Thy wisdom as a gift, set them up as the (only) medium to reach Thee, the only means to the eternal land of peace and happiness. One dwelled in Paradise until Thou sent him on (as the first Prophet). 
One was made to cruise the ""Ark"", and had been rescued, and kept safe from destruction through Thy mercy.
One was chosen and prepared for Thy Mission, as (Thy) Friend, (who) made a request to Thee for a good report in (his) later generations, so Thou approved and complied with, exalted them and gave them authority. 
One was spoken directly through the Tree, his brother was appointed his successor and helper. One was brought in without a father, was given clear proofs, and was supported with the Holy Spirit. 
For each Thou prescribed a Divine law, and set up a traced out path, each was appointed a guardian-executor, (and each) fulfilled the duty after being kept safe and protected, in the term of establishing Thy religion, a witness and argument over Thy servants (mankind), Lest the truth staggered from its firm stand and foundation, and the falsehood conquered the hearts of the people, and might not say a single man: ""If only Thou had sent a Messenger unto us as a Warner, to show us the path of wisdom and guidance, so that we might have followed Thy revelations before we were (thus) humbled and disgraced!"" Then Thou made plans to bring out the wonderful advent of Muhammad, (Send blessing on him and on his children). 
So Thou just as chose him master of Whosoever Thou created, made him (whom Thou Selected), pure, clean and the best, exalted and praised him (whom Thou elected), surpassed in generosity and liberality while bestowing high-mindedness and beneficence upon him (whom Thou took in confidence and relied upon); made him leader-in-chief of (all) thy Prophets, and sent him to the troubled world of men and jinn, among Thy servants, lowered and humbled before him the Easts and the Wests, under his total control was brought all affairs, exalted his soul in Thy heavens gave over to him the knowledge of what took place and what will happen, concerning facts and operation of creation. 
Then invested him with awe and majesty, Jibraeel, Meekaaeel, and distinguished Angels stood around; him at his beck and call, gave Thy word to him that Thou would make his religion prevail over all religions, however much the idolaters may be averse.
Thereafter acknowledged his atonement and provided good and perfection for his children, allotted for him and his children the first sanctuary appointed for mankind, at Becca (Mecca), a blessed place, a guidance to the people, wherein are plain and clear signs; the place where Ibraahim stood up to pray, and whosoever enters it is safe.
Thou said: ""Allah’s wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you, O ""People of the House"", and purify you with a thorough purification."" Thereupon Thou settled conclusively fee (recompense) of Muhammad (Thy blessings be on him and on his children) love for them, in Thy Holy Book. 
So Thou said: ""Say (O Muhammad): I ask of you no fee (recompense) therefore, save love of (my) Kinsfolk."" And Thou said: ""Whatever recompense (return) I have asked for you, (it) is only for yourselves."" And Thou said: ""I ask of you no reward for this, save that, whoso will, chooses a way unto his Lord."" Therefore they are the (only) means to (approach) Thee, the (only) medium to get Thy favours. 
So Thou certainly did not let his hard work go waste, and gave authority to his successor, Ali ibne Abi Taalib, (Thy blessings be on them both, and on this children), a guide. At the time when he was made a warner and a guide for every people, said he (the Holy Prophet), their Guide, in a public meeting overflowing with people; ""Of Whomsoever I am the Mawlaa (Lord, Master) Ali is his Mawlaa. O Allah! be a friend of him who is a friend of him, be an enemy of him who is an enemy of him, help that man who helps him, forsake that man who forsakes him"" and said: ""Of whosoever I am the Prophet Ali is his Chief."" 
And said: ""I and Ali are (one basic root of) a tree, and the rest of mankind are like diverse plants, he proclaims the position (relationship) of Haaroon to Moosaa."" Therefore he told him: ""I am to you as Moosaa was to Haaroon, but certainly there is no Prophet after me."" 
His (Ali’s) life partner was his (Muhammad’s) daughter the chief of the women of the worlds. Lawful was for him (Ali), in ""the mosque"", that which was permitted to him (Muhammad), all doors were closed, except his door. 
He (Muhammad) gave his knowledge and wisdom into his (Ali’s) keeping. He said: ""I am the city (center) of knowledge and Ali is its gate. 
Whoso desires to approach and dwell in the city of knowledge and wisdom should come through its door."" Thereafter he said: ""You are my brother, successor and inheritor, your flesh is my flesh, your blood is my blood, your truce is my truce, your fight is my fight, faith is blended, mixed and mingled (part and parcel) in your flesh and blood, just as it is compounded in my flesh and blood, you shall take charge of the reservoir of my inheritance, you are the fulfilment of my religion, you shall execute and keep alive my ""way of life"", your friends and followers shall speak with authority, command respect and hold the torch of good manners and refinements, their faces will be all around me in the eternal land of peace and bliss (Paradise), in my close company. 
Were it not you O Ali, the faithfuls would not know the truth after me."" After him (Muhammad) be (Ali) was the guide for the wanderers, a bright light in the blind darkness, the strong rope of Allah, and the right path, did not ever hold back kindness and compassion from the common people, nor ever made excuses or delay to give priority to the matters of religion, nor blew his own trumpet nor felt proud of his glory, did the same thing the Messenger used to do, (Blessing of Allah be on them both and on their children) put an end to misinterpretation, did not lose temper, for the sake of Allah, if any one turned to mud-slinging and name-calling. 
He had thrown the proud tribal chiefs of Arabia into a fright, destroyed their heroes, attacked and dispersed their cavalries, because of which hatred and deep grudge took root in their hearts. Badr, Khaybar, and Hunain created jealousy and envy in them, therefore, united they joined hands to oppose him, and came out in great number to fight against him, till he destroyed all deserters, who had swerved from what was right, the shameless who deviated from true religion, while he was carrying out the important mission.
Killed him a malicious criminal, a contemporary, serving the interest and following the doctrine of earlier impudent villians. An unparalleled and outlandish approach was applied to the directions of the Messenger of Allah, (Blessings of Allah be on him and on his children), concerning the ""Guides"" (Imaams), one after the other. The narrow-minded obstinate ""ummah"" did not care for and had ill-feelings towards him. 
Flocked together to pass up and deny his connection with his family, and pushed his children out of their way, but a handful of sincere faithfuls kept their promise and dutifully upheld the rights of his children; Some were slain, some were held prisoners, some were sent to distant foreign lands, and they met face to face (when came upon) their destiny (martyrdom). 
That which is given to each (of them) as reward of good deeds is the best recompense, since the earth belongs to Allah, and He gives it for an inheritance to whom He wants from among His servants, and the (good) end is for the God-fearing wise; glory to our Lord! Verily the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled; Allah does not break His word, He is Almighty, Wise.
So be purified and refined by making known and remembering the choicest children of Muhammad and Ali, blessings of Allah be on them both, and on their children. 
The heartbroken, in tears, make their hearts bleed, together with them, the deeply moved perceptive men of letters describe their wisdom and liberality, as they themselves used to do, eyes of sensitive and thoughtful people are full of overflowing tears, their voices choked up with emotion; they cry out to protest against the injustice done, they call up dumb and insensate souls to stir and take notice.

O inheritor of the exact science! O inheritor of the widely sought after culture and customs! O inheritor of the milestones of glory and greatness! O inheritor of the extraordinary events! O inheritor of the reason that had been put to experiment! O inheritor of the Right Path! O inheritor of the Message that made deep impression on mankind! O Son of him who is in the ""Mother of the Book"" kept with Allah, the Highest High, the All-wise.

O inheritor of the absolute joy and happiness! O inheritor of ""T’aa-haa"" and clear wisdom!

(The Highest High came near and received him gladly). If I but knew the destination of your purposeful journey! To which isolated land did you go? Good, pleasant and satisfying? Or otherwise? Or in well guarded concealment? It breaks my heart (when) I look at all that has been created, but cannot see you, nor hear a whisper about your whereabouts, nor any secret communication! It is disheartening to know that you are attending to and watching over the disorder and confusion, and I, in the thick of violent turmoil, am far away, unable to give report of injustice. 
I eagerly long for you who is out of sight, but has not forsaken us. I eagerly long for you who has departed and is invisible, but is not far from us. 
I eagerly long for you who inspires love and deep affection, and the faithful men and women take delight in your memorable glory. So we are excited with a longing desire. 
I eagerly long for you who is worthy of acceptance and lawful driving force of belief and conviction, never weary or annoyed. I eagerly long for you who is the root of praise and distinction, never can be uprooted. 
I eagerly long for you who is always tender, gentle and comforting, never makes one’s affairs worse instead of better. I eagerly long for you who is just and equitable beyond a trace of doubt, does not take severe action until misbehaviour trespasses the limit. 
O Master! How long and unto what is to be directed (my) request for friendly attention concerning you? And what is the message? It makes me sad to get favourable reply from anyone other than you, but to be duped and cheated in the end. 
It casts a gloom upon me that you suffered hardships and the chicken hearted deserters left you alone. It is painful for me what took place for you from them and that which had happened. 
Is there a helper with whom I may cooperate and take pains? Is there a restless with whom I may share when action is taken? Is there a faint twinkle of evidence to make me willingly take up the trouble? Do you O Son of Ahmed have means and ways to arrange our meeting? Can you once cleverly guide the course of time, so that we may obtain our wish? When shall we abridge the gap that separate us from the vision so that we may refer to the authority? How long shall we keep waiting for your pleasing satisfying essence and quality? Already the period of expectation has lasted too long! When shall we receive our share from you and have our minds set at rest? For we have fixed our eyes upon you and strive with perseverance. When shall we be happy, and see your beautiful form and fine aspect? Groups of cheerful willing disciplined helpers, in great numbers, gathering around you to carry out one work after the other! You fulfilling (every promise) and giving joy, heart and confidence (to the faithfuls); filling the earth with justice; making your enemies follow the law and accept the revolution; taking the wind out of the haughty and the boastful, and those who knew but denied the truth; breaking the back of the proud and the arrogant; uprooting the roots of the unjust; and we-singing the praise of Allah, the Lord of the worlds. 
O my Allah! Thou disperses the clouds of sorrows and hardships. Unto Thee we turn to ask for help against the enemy; for Thou (alone) helps and guides. Thou (alone) puts into good order affairs of this world and shall make better the Hereafter. So come to help! O He Who is called to help the helpless, Thy servants, surrounded by calamities. 
Show them the face of their Leader. O the Mightiest Almighty. Allow him to put an end to evil and corruption, and satisfy his Love (for the faithfuls) and dislike (for the sinners). O He Who, from the ""Arsh directs and controls all creation, and unto Him is the return, final and ultimate. 
O my Allah! We are Thy servants, longing for Thy friend (appointed authority), who reminds us of Thee, and Thy Prophet, who was created as a refuge and asylum for us, established as a foundation and spring of truthfulness for us, and was made the Leader-Guide of the faithfuls. Convey to him our heartfelt congratulations and welcome. 
Make us feel more deeply for him. O Lord! Very Kindly, make his headquarters our place of domicile and dwelling abode, and fulfill Thy promise by returning him to us as our Leader Guide, so that he takes us to the eternal land of peace and bliss, where we shall rub elbows with Thy sincere servants who shed blood to pronounce the Faith. 
O Allah send Thy blessings on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad. Bless his ancestor Muhammad, the Messenger, the foremost Leader, and bless his progenitor, the succeeding Leader, and his great grandmother, the ever truthful, Faatimah daughter of Muhammad, and his chosen virtuous forefathers, and send blessings on him, superior, whole, conclusive, staying, numerous, and full, not ever bestowed (even) on any of Thy sincerely attached and pious friends from among Thy creation. 
Bless him with blessings, (that) cannot be counted in numbers, cannot be ""proximated"" in space of time, cannot be consumed in terms of having nothing remaining. 
O my Allah! Set up truth, destroy falsehood, show the right path to Thy friends, humiliate Thy enemies, and do it without interruption, (through him). O my Allah! Unite us with him. 
Let us be friends with his ancestors. Give us courage to disperse those who oppose and try to prevent him, and make them stay in their shame and disgrace for ever. 
Help us to discharge the duties made incumbent upon us by him, and make every effort to obey him, keep from that which is declared unlawful by him, rely upon him to get his approval. 
Let us be with him when he makes peace, and frees mankind from fear, gives currency to love are kindness, brings bliss and happiness, spreads good and virtue, so that we may do our best to promote his cause through Thy mercy, and win victory for Thee. Accept our prayers, forgive our sins, fulfil our desires, give us means of livelihood, unrestricted, make less our hardships, meet our demands in full (through him). 
Turn towards us Thy kindness and loving aspects, and bring us close to Thee. Turn the eyes of Thy mercy upon us, to bring to fullness Thy kind favours, and after that do not ever let them disappear in the name of Thy generosity, and give us the opportunity to quench our thirst from the spring of his great grandfather (Kawsar), (blessing of Allah be on him and on his children), using his cup, filled by him, fresh and pure, sufficient, wholesome, clear and cool, not leaving any desire thereafter, O the Most Merciful.",,دعائے ندبہ,دعای ندبه,دُعاءُ الندبة,दुआ नुदबा,Dua Nudba,nudba.mp3,,,

O Allah, keep me steadfast on Your religion, keep me prepared for Your obedience all the time and keep my heart soft for the master of Your affair. Save me from those trials in which You involve Your creatures. And keep me steadfast on the obedience of Your Wali whom You have concealed from the view of Your creatures. Who is waiting for Your command and You are the learned without being taught, about the time when the circumstances of Your Wali will be reformed and when he will reappear and the veil of occultation shall be opened. Then give me patience so that I don’t make haste in what You have delayed or that I be inclined to the delay of that which You want to hasten. And that I do not ask of the exposition of what You have concealed. And search for that which You have concealed. Or that I should be dissatisfied with what You have decreed. And I should not say why and how the hidden Imam is not reappearing while the world is fraught with injustice and oppression. I have entrusted all my affairs to You. O Allah, I ask You to let me see the incomparable elegance of Your Wali when his rules shall be enforced. I know that the proof, argument, evidence, exigency, intention and strength is all for You only. So do this favor on me and the believers that we see Your Wali Amr. Your bliss be on him and his progeny. In this way should His command become apparent and his guidance should become clear. He is one who brings out from misguidance to guidance and one who cures from the malady of ignorance. O Lord, reveal his countenance, make his pillars firm and include us among those who witness his incomparable elegance. And give is the good sense (Taufeeq) to serve him. And that we may die on his faith and are raised in his army. O Allah, protect the hidden Imam whom You have created from every kind of mischief, whom You brought from nonentity to being, whom You created, raised up and gave a form. And protect the Imam from the evil that comes to him from the front and from behind. From right and the left. From above and from below. Keep him in Your protection. In a protection after which none can harm him. And through him protect the Prophet and the successor of the Prophet. O Allah, give the Imam of the Age a long life. Increase his lifespan. Help him in the Wilayat and rulership that you will grant to him. He is the guided one, one who will establish the truth, the pure, pious, sincere, satisfied, pleasing, patient, one who makes effort in the way of Allah and the thankful one. O Allah, do not destroy our certainty due to the prolongation of his occultation and due to lack of news about him. Give us perfect faith in his remembrance, in his awaiting and in him. Do not make us careless of our duty of praying for him and for invoking divine blessings on him. Do not make us fall in despair for his reappearance and we should have firm certainty in his advent like we are certain of the advent of Your Messenger. And like we have faith in all that was revealed on the Prophet. Make our faith in these things strong. Till You make me walk the path of guidance by the Great Proof and the middle path. Give us the capability of his obedience and keep us steadfast in following him. Include us among his forces, his friends and his helpers. And make us among those who are satisfied with each of his actions. And don’t deprive us of this bounty; neither in the lifetime nor at the time of death. Till we die on the same faith and certainty. Make us not among those who doubt or those who break the covenant or those who fall in sloth or those who deny. O Allah, hasten his reappearance and help him and help those who help him. Abandon whose who desert him and destroy those who are inimical to him and those who deny him. Through his being make the true religion apparent. Through him destroy falsehood. Through him save the believers from degradation. Inhabit the cities through his blessings. Eliminate the oppressors of disbelief through him. Destroy the strength of the leaders of the misguided ones and humiliate the tyrants and disbelievers through him. Through his destroy all the hypocrites, oath-breakers, irreligious that live in the east and the west of the earth, on land and on water, in plains or hills so that neither their cities should remain nor their vestiges. And that Your cities may be purified from them. And cure the hearts of Your servants from them, and through the Imam of the Age revive all that has been destroyed from Your religion, all the laws that have been changed and all Your practices that have been altered. Through the Imam reform all these things so that Your religion get a new lease of life and becomes perfect. The divine laws should become worthy of being followed without any hesitation and innovation. Due to his just rule the fire of disbelief should be extinguished because he is the one whom You have kept especially for Yourself. Whom You chose for helping Your Prophet. You chose him for Your knowledge and protected him from sins and immune from all defects. And You informed him of the secrets of the Unseen and sent Your bounties upon him. You kept him away from every impurity and clean from every ignorance and disobedience. O Allah, bless them and their purified forefathers. And on their prominent Shias; and fulfill his hope. And keep this supplication of us pure from every doubt and show-off. So that we do not intend to please anyone but You. O Allah, we beseech in Your court that our Prophet is also not among us. And our leader is also hidden from us. We are surrounded by hardships and trials of the world. The enemies have got an upper hand over us. Your opponents are more and our numbers are few. So, Allah, save us from these calamities at the earliest and give us victory through the just Imam. O the true deity, accept our plea. O Allah, we beseech You to permit Your Wali to express Your justice among Your servants and that he may slay Your enemies till there does not remain any caller to oppression. O Lord, demolish the pillars of oppression and destroy the foundations of tyranny. Demolish their pillars and blunt their sword. Make their weapons useless. Lower their flags and eliminate their fighters. Put discord into their forces. O Lord, send down hard stones upon them and hit them with Your sharp sword. Do not turn away the severity of Your chastisement from the criminals. Send down chastisement on the enemies of Your Wali and the enemies of Your Messenger through the hands of Your Wali and the hands of Your servants. O Lord, suffice for Your Hujjat and Your Wali in the earth from the fear of their enemies. And nullify the plots that they devise for him. Imprison in the circle of evil one who intends bad for the Qaim. Remove the mischief of the world through his blessed existence and put awe into the hearts of his enemies. Make the steps of his enemies waver. Leave his enemies confused and send down severe chastisement on them. Degrade them among Your servants. Make them accursed in Your cities. And put them in the lowest level of Hell. And send your worst punishment for them. Fasten them with fire and fill the graves of their dead with fire. And tie them with the fire of Hell. They are the same who considered Prayer unimportant, who followed their base desires and humiliated Your servants. O Allah, revive the Quran through Your Wali. Show us its effulgence which is permanent and in which there is no darkness. Enliven the dead hearts through him. Cure the hearts which are full of malice. And through him bring together on truth different selfish desires. Through him revive the laws that have been made obsolete so that the truth becomes triumphant and justice is established. O Lord, include us among his helpers. That we may strengthen his rule and be of those who follow his commands and are satisfied with each of his actions. Make us of those who submit to his commands. Make us such that people do not have to resort to dissimulation from us. O Lord, You are the only one who saves from every harm. You answer the prayer of the helpless. You save from great sorrow and pain. Thus O Lord, remove every harm from Your Wali. Appoint him as Your Caliph on the earth as You have decided about him. O Lord, do make me of those who dispute with the Aale Muhammad and don’t make me among their enemies. Don’t make me one who is displeased and angry with Aale Muhammad. Thus I seek Your refuge from this; so please give me refuge. And I beseech You to grant me. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad and make me successful with them in the world and the hereafter and make me from those who are proximate to You.",(Long),دعائے معرفت امام زمانہ,دعای عصر غیبت,دعاء زمن الغیبة,दुआ मारिफत-ए-इमाम (atfs),Dua Marefat e Imam (atfs),allahummaarifninafsak_long.mp3,,,

11,Hadith-e-Kisa,"HADEETH-E-KISA  details
Hadeeth-e-Kisa is that gracious description, which is a Tradition too and a description and an event too, a description of excellences also and a reason of prosperity too – Who is among the believers not aware of the words or meaning of this gracious Hadeeth, this is the Hadeeth healing the ill, the medium of fulfilling the desires of the desirous, supporting the helpless person engulfed in calamities – Just as this fact has also been mentioned itself in it that, by reciting it the mercy of Allah descends, and angels come and are busy asking for forgiveness – If recited before an owner of insight then better and spacious conditions are attained, if recited before a needy person then his needs are fulfilled, and since hundreds of years the believers are deriving the benefits of it’s graces, and why should it not be? It is a recital of the owners of infallibility and purity, a mention of Siddiqa-e-Tahera (s.a.w.a), a commentary of the Holy Qur’an, an event of the assembly of Allah’s lights, amazement and hope for the dwellers of Allah’s throne and the greatness and excellence for the best of humans and it’s pure roots – If, in presence of these specialities if grace, prosperity and mercy does not descend then when?
As per it’s authenticity, Hadeeth-e-Kisa is highly reliable, whose authenticity has been traced by a great honourable Scholar of Bahrain, Sheikh Abdullah Bahrani in his book Awaalim and he saw it written by the pen of Sheikh Jaleel Sayyid Hashim Bahrani – He from Sheikhul Hadeeth Sayyid Majid Bahrani (r.a.), he from Sheikh Hasan ibne Zaynuddin, he from Sheikh Muqaddas Ardbaili (r.a.) he from Sheikh Ali ibne Abdul aalaa al Karki (r.a.), he from Ali ibne Hilal al Jazaaeri, he from Ahmad ibne Fahdal Hilli (r.a.), he from Ali ibne Khazanal Haaeri (r.a.), he from Sheikh Ziauddin Ali ibne Shaheedal Awwal (r.a.), he from Shaheede Awwal (r.a.), he from Fakhrul Muttaqeen (r.a.), he from his revered father Allamah Hilli (r.a.), he from his elder Mohaqqiqe Hilli (r.a.), he from his elder ibne Numma Hilli (r.a.), he from his Sheikh Mohammad ibne Idris Hilli (r.a.), he from ibne Hamza Toosi (r.a.) author of Thaqibul Manaaqib, he from Allamah Mohammad ibne Shahr Aashob (r.a.), he from Allamah Tabrasi (r.a.) author of Ihtejaaj, he from Sheikh Jaleel Hasan ibne Mohammad ibnal Hasanal Toose, he from his revered father Sheikhut Taaif (r.a.), he from his teacher Sheikh Mufiid (r.a.) he from Sheikh ibne Qawliya-e-Qummi (r.a.), he from Sheikh Kulayni (r.a.), he from Ali ibne Ibrahiim (r.a.), he from Ibrahim ibne Hashim (r.a.), he from Ahmad ibne Mohammad ibne Abi Nasral Bazanti (r.a.), he from Qasim ibne Yahya al Jila al Kufi (r.a.), he from Abu Baseer (r.a.), he from Aabaan ibne Taghlab (r.a.), he from Jabir ibne Yazid, he from Jabir ibne Abdullah Ansari and he heard from Siddiqa-e-Tahera (s.a.) that……
Due to the unawareness of this authenticity looking at the starting words roveya an Fatemahtiz Zahra of the narration, objected that, this narration is weak, it’s narrator is not known, and a narration starting with a passive text cannot be relied upon, whereas surely it is not so – Roveya has been used as a brevity or for a honour, otherwise a chain of authenticity is present for the narration, and for it one after another great honourable, authenticating, and reliable scholars’ names are mentioned, after which there remains no place for any doubt or suspicion.
A copy of this Hadeeth has been entered in the book of Allamah Sheikh Mohammad Taqi ibne Mohammad Baqir Yazdi Bafqi, which he has directly traced from Awaalim, and has quoted that, this Hadeeth is present in the book Awaalim, which is in more than 70 volumes, and is secure in the library of Hujjatul Islam Aaqae Mirza Sulayman in Yazd – 11th volume is regarding the events of Siddiqa-e-Tahera (s.a.), and in this itself this noble Hadeeth is found.
Allamah Sheikh Mohammad Saduqi Yazdi (r.a.), quotes that this Hadeeth is quoted in the annotation of Awaalim – But, is, by all means, present in the original book.
The second copy is of the author of Majma-ul-Bahrain, Allama Jaleel Sheikh Fakhruddin Mohammadal Turaehi, which is generally concurrent in our countries, and from this angel there is a distinctive difference in both of them, as in this copy there is no reply along with the Salaam (salutations), whereas in the copy of Awaalim the salaam and it’s reply both are present.
Other than this in the copy of Awaalim some other additions are also there, which are not mentioned in Muntakhabe Turaehi.
Allamah Delmi (r.a.) too in his book Ghurarud Durar has quoted this Hadeeth, and Allamah Sheikh Mohammad Jawad ar Razi has also mentioned in his book Noorul Aafaaq, and from his quotation it is clear that this Hadeeth is in the 11th volume of Awaalim also and in the 13th volume also.
Any way regarding the differences in expressions, it is necessary to hint at some of the specialities, so that the investigators can benefit from these points, and the believers gain from their achievements.
1. In the copy of Awaalim, the reply of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) for the salaam of everyone coming under the blanket (Kisa) is quoted, which is exactly according to the commands of Islam – And in those copies in which the reply of salaam is not found, is only due to brevity or these scholars have not deemed it as a salaam of benediction, whose reply is obligatory.
2. In the copy of Awaalim, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a) has mentioned some additions after every salaam, as per the rules of Islam – For example, for Imam Hasan (a.s.) He replied, Waladee wa saaheba Hawzee, for Imam Husayn (a.s.) Waladee wa shaafe’e ummatee, and for Ali (a.s.) Khalifatee wa saahebal Vaa’a, on which the intellectuals can put more light.
3. In the copy of Awaalim after the collection of all (Panjetan paak) these remarks of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a) is also quoted: “O! Lord these are my Ahle Bayt and are my specials, their flesh is my flesh, their blood is my blood, whoever troubles them I am troubled by if, whoever pains them I am pained by it, whoever fights with them I fight with them, and whoever compromises with them I compromise with them, whoever is their enemy is also my enemy, and a friend of them is my friend, they are from me and I am from them, O! Lord please do make Your greetings, mercy and grace and forgiveness and Your will, a part of their state, and keep away from them all the defects and declare their Purity”.
These words are not found in common copies, whence in it is founds the complete series of virtues and excellences.
4. In the copy of Awaalim along with Falakan, Tasree is quoted, whereas in other copies, Yasree and Tasree both are quoted. The word Fulk is singular and plural both.
5. In the last part of the Hadeeth, Awaalim quotes “We rabbil K’abate” as stated by the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a) after both of his mentions, whereas in other copies it is quoted once only.
In Hadeeth-e-Kisa, such spiritual virtues of Aale Mohammad (a.s.) are found that a person goes on penetrating in them and experiences the ecstasy on their spirituality, and goes on swinging on the eloquence of Siddiqa-e-Tahera (s.a.) – Some parts of this fact has already hinted at initially, and some are hinted now:
The Holy Prophet has not mentioned illness but has mentioned of weakness, and it is quite apparent that the healing of weakness is different from curing illness.
The Holy Prophet’s weakness is related to body, and not the constitution, and an eloquent difference is found in this, as in the constitution head is also included – But a body is excluding the head, which means that the weakness (mentioned) cannot be related to head and brain.
The Ahle Bayt have been as members of the house, for Prophethood, and have been deemed a mine for Messengership, which clearly means that not the house members of the Prophet, but a family of Prophethood, and Allah’s message will be achieved by us from them only.
For the assembly, the word “Shi’a” and “Devotee” both are used, which are well distinguished as per belief (Aqeedah) and deeds (Amal).
In declaring of the “Successful” the promise of the Lord of Ka’bah is mentioned, the example of which is also found in the last moments of the master of the universe.
Lastly it is necessary to make this clear that, in izaa wajhohoo yatalaa laa the word is izaa and not izan – The word izan is used in the last part of the Hadeeth, the difference of which can be orderly sensed by the owners of intellect and literature.
Allaahumma J’alna minhum wah shuma Mohammadinw Wa allehit Taahereen.","In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate
Fatimatuz-Zahra, the daughter of the Prophet, peace be on them, is to have thus 
related ( an event ) :
My father, the Prophet of Allah, came to my house one day and said to me : ""Peace be on you, Fatimah""
I replied : ""And upon you be peace""
Then he said : ""I feel weakness in my body""
I said : ""Allah protects you from weakness, father""
He said : ""Fatimah, please bring Yemeni cloak and cover me with it""
So, I brought the Yemeni cloak and covered him with it.
Then, I looked at him and saw that his face was shining like a full moon with its 
glory and splendor After a while, my son Hasan came in and said : ""Peace be on you, mother""
I replied : ""And upon you peace, O light of my eyes, and the delight of my heart""
He then said : ""Mother! I smell a fragrance so sweet and so pure as that of my grandfather, the Prophet of Allah""
I replied : ""Yes. Your grandfather is lying underneath the cloak""
Hasan went near the cloak and said : ""Peace be on you, my grandfather, the Prophet of Allah; May I enter the cloak with you?""
He replied : ""And upon you peace, my son and the master of my fountain (Kauthar), you are given the permission to enter""
So, Hasan entered the cloak with him.
After a while, my Husain came in and said : ""Peace be on you, mother""
I replied : ""And upon you peace, O light of my eyes, and the delight of my heart""
He then said : ""Mother! I smell a sweet fragrance like that of my grandfather, the Prophet of Allah""
I replied : ""Yes. Your grandfather and your brother are lying underneath the cloak""
Husain stepped towards the cloak and said : ""Peace be on you, my grandfather, the Chosen of Allah; May I enter the cloak with you?""
He replied : ""And upon you peace, my son and interceder of my followers, you are given the permission to enter""
So, Husain entered the cloak with them.
After a while, Abul Hasan, Ali bin Abi Talib came in and said : ""Peace be on you, O daughter of the Prophet of Allah""
I replied : ""And upon you peace, O father of Hasan, and the Commander of the faithful""
He then said : ""Fatimah! I smell a sweet fragrance like that of my brother, (my cousin), the Prophet of Allah""
I replied : ""Yes. He is underneath the cloak with your two sons""
So, Ali went near the cloak and said : ""Peace be on you, Prophet of Allah; May I enter the cloak with you?""
He replied : ""And upon you peace, my brother, my legatee, my successor, and my standard bearer, you are given the permission to enter""
So, Ali entered the cloak with them.
Then I stepped forward and said : ""Peace be on you, my father, O Prophet of Allah; May I enter the cloak with you?""
He replied : ""And upon you peace, my daughter, O part of my self; you are given the permission to enter""
So, I entered the cloak with them.
Getting together underneath the cloak, my father, the Prophet of Allah, held the two ends of the cloak and raised his right hand towards the heavens and prayed :
""O Allah, these are the people of my Household (Ahlul-Bayt). They are my confidants and my supporters.
Their flesh is my flesh and their blood is my blood.
Whoever hurts them, hurts me too.
Whoever displeases them, displeased me too.
I am at war with those at war with them.
I am at peace with those at peace with them.
I am the enemies of their enemies and
I am the friend of their friends.
They are from me and I am from them.
O Allah! Bestow Your Blessings, Benevolence, Forgiveness and Your pleasure upon me 
and upon them. And remove impurity from them and keep them thoroughly pure""
Then the Lord, Almighty Allah said :
""O My angels! O Residents of My Heavens, verily, I have not created the erected Sky, the stretched earth, the illuminated moon, the bright sun, the rotating 
planets, the flowing seas and the sailing ships, but for the love of these Five lying underneath the cloak""
Gabriel, the trusted angel, asked : ""Who are under the cloak?""
The Almighty answered : ""They are the Household of the Prophet and the assets of Prophethood. They are : Fatimah, her father, her husband and her two sons""
Gabriel said : ""O Lord, May I fly to earth to be the sixth of them?""
Allah replied : ""Yes. You are given the permission""
Gabriel, the trusted, landed near them and said : ""Peace be on you, O Prophet of Allah. The All-Highest conveys His peace on you and His greetings and says:
""By My Honor and Glory, O My angels! O Residents of My Heavens, verily, I have not created the erected Sky, the stretched earth, the illuminated moon, the bright sun, the rotating planets, the flowing seas and the sailing ships, but for your sake and love""
God has given me permission to enter the cloak with you. May I join you, O Prophet of Allah?""
The Prophet replied : ""And peace be on you, O trusted bearer of Allah's Revelations! you are granted the permission""
So, Gabriel entered the cloak with us and said to my father : ""Allah sends His Revelations to you"" Verily Allah's desire is to remove blemish from you, O People of Household (Ahlul-Bayt) and purify you with a perfect purification""
Then Ali said to my father: ""O Prophet of Allah, tell me: What significance has Allah reserved from His grace for this gathering of ours under this cloak?""
The Prophet replied: ""I swear by He who rightfully appointed me a Prophet and selected me with prophethood as a saviour: this episode of ours will not be recounted in any gathering from the gatherings of the people of the earth where a group of our shias and lovers are present except that there will descend upon them mercy! And angels will encircle them asking Allah the remission of their sins until the assembly disperses!""
So Ali said: ""In that case, We have attained success, and our Shias have attained success, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!""
Then the Prophet replied a second time: ""O Ali! I swear by He who rightfully appointed me a Prophet and selected me with prophethood as a saviour: this episode of ours will not be recounted in any gathering from the gatherings of the people of the earth where a group of our shias and lovers are present and there be a person present full of grief except that Allah will remove his grief! And no person in distress except that will dispel his distress! And no seeker of any wish except that Allah grants his wish!
So Ali stated: ""In that case, by Allah! We have attained success and felicity, and our followers also have attained success and felicity, in this world and the hereafter, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!""",,حدیث شریف کساء,حدیث شریف کساء,حدیث الکساء,हदीस-ए-किसा,Hadith-e-Kisa,kisa.mp3,,,
12,Dua Ahad,"Imam Sadiq (a.s) narrates that “one who recites this supplication for 40 mornings; he will be accounted amongst the helpers of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s). And if he happens to die before the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s), Allah will raise him up from his rave so that he may assist the holy Imam (a.t.f.s).For every word that he recites in this supplication, Allah will grant him 1000 good deeds and will erase from his scroll of deeds 1000 sins”. 
As the title suggests, this supplication is of allegiance (ahad) to the holy Imam (a.t.f.s). Its recitation every morning ensures the renewal of this covenant. The reciter finds himself under the leadership of Imam (a.t.f.s).The reciter beseeches All to include him among the helpers and aides of Imam (a.t.f.s) and to grant him the opportunity to attain martyrdom in his presence. Also, he requests Allah that should he die before the reappearance of Imam (a.t.f.s). Allah should raise him up from his grave so that he may assist him (a.t.f.s) in his mission. 
There is a fervent appeal to Allah to grant him the honour of seeing Imam (a.t.f.s). In this there is also an acknowledgement that the difficulties of this nation can be solved only by the reappearance of Imam (a.t.f.s) and that believers see it as being close while others deem it to be distant.","O Allah!

And hasten his reappearance, make his arrival smooth, vasten his path, make me tread on his way and implement his authority and strengthen his back. O Allah inhabit Your cities through him and give life to Your servants due to him for surely You have said and Your word is truth, ""Corruption will become rampant in land and on sea because of the evil which men's hand have earned"" Then O Allah manifest for us Your slave and the son of Your Prophet's daughter, whose name is the same as that of Your messenger, so that nothing from falsehood is victorious except that he tears them (falsehood) to pieces, establishes the truth and the truth confirms him. And O Allah! Appoint him as a refuge for Your oppressed servants and a helper for the one who does not find any helper for himself except You and the renewer of all the laws of Your book which have been tampered with and the rebuilder of the science of Your religion and the traditions of Your Prophet (peace of Allah be on him and his progeny) and O Allah! make him among those whom you have protected from the evils of the adversaries. 
O Allah! and provide joy to Your Prophet Mohammed (peace be on him and his progeny) by his vision and (the vision of) the one who follows him on his call and have mercy on our poverty after his arrival O Allah remove his sorrow (of occultation) from this nation with his presence and hasten for us his reappearance.

14,Dua Sardaab (Cellar),"Whoso pays a visit to ""Sardaab"" (Cellar), in Sammarah, where our Living Imam (Imam S'aah'ibaz Zamaan) was seen last before his invisible life began, recites the following Dua'a, mentioned in ""Misbah"" on the authority of Imam Ali ar-Reza (a.s.)

This dua'a is also recited on Friday because of the above noted reasons.","O Allah! Send blessings on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad.

In the name of Allah, the beneficent, the Merciful. O Allah!

Defend They friend and representative-a decisive argument for mankind. They mouthpiece, interprets the “vision” with reason and logic, making use of the Thy wisdom; They watchtower, looks after and watches out on Thy behalf; Thy evidence in the midst of the people, examines everything closely and brings it to a conclusion, struggles against difficulties, virile, in full possession of the faculties, a promise from Thee for ultimate fulfillment; Keep him safe from the intrigues and evil schemes of all that which Thou created, set free, let live and dispersed.

Protect him from that which is there in his presence, from that which comes from behind, from the right or left, from above or below, a careful watch that does not let that which it watches over go out of sight, as Thou did in the times of Thy Messenger and his (Imam’s) forefathers, Guides appointed by Thee.
 The mainstay of Thy religion. Take him in Thy safe keeping that never go slack, let him have they safe escort that never relax, make him difficult to get inaccessible (for hostile intriguers), not to be irritated and annoyed. Afford security to him in Thy safe and trustworthy sanctuary that does not forsake him who takes asylum in it. Surround him from all sides to guard and protect – an enclosure that does not throw out any one after taking in. Help him with Thy powerful support. Assist him with Thy superior weaponry that always win and dominate. Impart Thy strength and power to him. Put Thy reserve of countless Angles at his disposal. Be a friend of him who is in his good books. Be hostile to him who is his enemy. Cover him completely from all sides with Thy fortified armour. Appoint Thy Angles to stand guard on all corners, border to border, rim to rim.

O Allah through him patch up the differences of opinion, bring into order again confusion and disruption, 
tighten the rope around. (the neck of) oppression, give currency to justice fairplay, make this world a beautiful award by prolonging his stay, extend him the necessary support, support him with all-out help, give heart and confidence to his supporters, leave the deserters helpless in the lurch, give over to destruction those who lay traps for him. Annihilate those who deceive him, put an end to the reign of terror, perpetrated by powerful infidels, establish him, back him up, break them all to pieces – the haughty worthless reprobates, the trend setters of schism and heresy, the counterfeiters or “Sunnah” (prophet’s way of life), and the watchdogs of falsehood; humble and disgrace the tyrants, destroy the infidels, and all hypocrites and intriguers, through him whether they are in the east or west, on the lands or over the seas, between the valleys or atop the mountains, till none of them is able to find a hideout, and not a trace of them is visible.
 O Allah, clear up Thy lands from them, let Thy servants rejoice in their total disappearance; and through him give satisfaction to the faithfuls. re-establish the Messenger’s way of life, make public the Prophet’s injunctions, put back in original form that which has been uprooted from Thy religion, and set aright changes make in Thy commandments, till Thy “ideal system” is fully restored through him, on his hands, well-defined, liberal, welfare-oriented, free from loopholes, twists and turns; not tempered with and messed up, till the darkness of totalitarian reign of terror disappears in the bright light of his justice and fairplay, the burdensome yoke of infidelity is thrown away, untie and make loose through him the knots of realities, because verily he is Thy servant whom Thou saved for Thyself-pure, of best quality, Thy sincere friend, Thou selected him to give charge of Thy invisible domain of authority, kept him free from faults and errors, set him free from defects, purified him from uncleanness, kept him safe from pollution and impurity.

O Allah! Truly, we shall be with him on the Day of Judgement, and on the impending day of Resurrection, because certainly he does not make mistakes, nor undertakes anything which is unlawful, nor unites people for a bad purpose, nor loses his way in Thy obedience, nor laughs at or makes fund of anything declared sacred by Thee, nor makes changes in the legal setup prescribed by Thee, nor makes changes in the legal conduct instead of the divine law enacted by Thee. Verily he is the Guide, the rightly guided, the pure, the approved, the wise.

O Allah! Set in motion at once his wish and desire, and of his family, children, descendents, followers, and all human beings, which bring him near too his purpose, 
make him advance to the reality he has in mind. Put under his sphere of influence all human societies, existing in any form, near and far, big and small, till his “directions” take the place of all systems of laws, and his truthfulness puts an end to every falsehood.
 O Allah I beseech Thee the reactivate and establish the route unto true guidance, the proved beyond doubt thesis, the equitable way of life, to which will come back (repentant) those who had gone too far (exceeded the bounds), catch up and reach those who had fallen down and were left behind. Encourage and make us ready to carry out his directions, let us stand firmly and permanently among his followers, keep us safe in the company of his obedient disciples, include us in his party, standing upright, well-ordered, firm, waiting, keeping in check desires along with those who see Thy approval as advised by him, till the day Thou shall raise us for the Last Judgement in the company of his helpers, supporters and those who backed him up wholeheartedly.

O Allah! Let us be sincerely free from any trace of doubt, suspicion, cunning and hypocrisy, to an extent that we do not rely on anyone other than Thee, nor seek fulfillment of our wants in any form except turning to Thee. And put us up in his neighborhood close to his abode, in the land of eternal peace and joy, along with him; Let us find a place where we shall not feel tired, disgusted, annoyed, lazy (negligent) and weary, let us be among those who have watered abundantly Thy Religion, and had the distinction of lending a hand to Thy beloved representative, do not give or place to others who are not from us and then behold if Thou wills to give compensation to others, please show mercy to them, but for us, the share from They generosity must be plentiful.

O Allah send blessings on the “Covenanted authority” and on the “Guides” (Imams) after him; make them known distinctly and clearly, eagerly hoped for, stretching far and wide their sphere of influence, help them in every way, make perfect and complete for them that which props and supports them in carrying out Thy will and command, and demonstrate, prove and register their claim, include us among their friends, ready helpers in the cause of Thy region because they are the source of Thy “words”, and treasure of Thy wisdom, the spirit and confidence of Thy Oneness; the status and discipline of Thy religion, the authority according to Thy command, the most sincere among Thy servants, the choicest among all Thy creation, Thy beloved intimate friends, children of Thy Prophet, peace be upon him and on them and Mercy of Allah and his blessings.

O Allah send blessings on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad. ",,دعائے سرداب,دعای امام رضا(ع) برای حضرت بقیه الله(عج),دعاء السرداب,दुआ सरदाब (केलर),Dua Sardaab (Cellar),sardaab.mp3,,,
15,Allahumma Arzuqna Taufiqa,"This supplication begins thus
It has been recorded by the eminent traditionalist, Shaykh Abbas Qummi (r.a.), in his renowned compilation, 'Mafatihul Jinaan'. He has reported this invocation on the authority of Shaykh Kafami from the latter's 'Misbahul Mutahajjid'. It is recommended that this supplication be recited after every obligatory namaaz or for that matter at any other time. (This supplication is mentioned in 'Mafatihul Jinaan' before the fifteen supplications of Imam Sajjad (a.s. )). Considering the veracity of this supplication, and with an eye on brevity, we have not mentioned the chain of transmitters.
A supplication generally commences by invoking Allah as in 'Allahumma` , which means 'O Allah'. The very next word `arzokna' , means grant us sustenance. The word sustenance is by and large associated with food and succour. However, this word is also used to imply bounties associated with both this world, as well as the hereafter. In other words, any bounty, aid, assistance, etc., granted by Allah is dubbed as 'razk' and this could be in the guise of 'taufeeq' to perform some action or it could be some monetary benefit or an increase in knowledge and recognition (ma'refat). Granting sustenance is the exclusive domain of Allah as He Himself mentions in the Quran:","O Allah!
· Grant us the good fortune of being obedient [to You], and keep us away from disobedience.
· Let us be sincere in our intentions;
· Provide us with the knowledge of what is sacred.
O Allah!
· Honor us with guidance and honesty­, and direct our tongues to what is right and wise;
· fill our hearts with learning and knowledge, and cleanse our stomachs from what is forbidden and of doubt.
O Allah!
· Prevent our hands from committing oppression and theft, lower our gaze [out of modesty] from immorality and disloyalty, and
block our ears from hearing foolish talk and slander.
O Allah!
· Oblige our learned scholars with piety and sincere advice, and those who are learning with restrain and desire to learn.
· Bless those who are with desire to follow the religious teachings, 
· impart recovery and comfort to the Muslims suffering from illness and bless those dead among them with kindness and mercy.
O Allah!
· Award dignity and peace of mind to old people,
· Confer repentance and turning away from sin to our young people,
· Bestow modesty and chastity to our women.
O Allah!
· Supply the rich with humility and abundance; and the poor with patience and contentment.
O Allah!
· Let those fighting in Your way be victorious, and the imprisoned be freed.
O Allah!
· Let the rulers be just and kind and the ruled receive just treatment and good character;
· Bless those who are on pilgrimage with adequate support, and helping them complete what is obligatory on them

16,Dua Allahummah Asleh,"Ibn Maqatil reported that Abu Al-Hasan Rida (peace be upon him) said: what do you say in your Qunut on Friday prayers? What the people normally say I replied, he said: don't say what the people normally say rather recite the following:","O Allah! Reform conditions of Your servant and caliph with those means by which You have reformed conditions of Your messengers and prophets. Surround him with the angels and support him with the Holy Spirit. Appoint protectors from the front and behind him, (those) who would guard him from all troubles and calamities. Convert his fear into security, (so that) he may worship only You and doesn't associate anybody with You. Do not make any of Your creatures an authority over Your vicegerent.

17,Aayat al-Kursi,Recitation of Ayatul Kursi Results in the Focus of Allah upon His Servants,"2.255: Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His; who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases, His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great.
2.256: There is no compulsion in religion; truly the right way has become clearly distinct from error; therefore, whoever disbelieves in the Shaitan and believes in Allah he indeed has laid hold on the firmest handle, which shall not break off, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing.
2.257: Allah is the guardian of those who believe. He brings them out of the darkness into the light; and (as to) those who disbelieve, their guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the darkness; they are the inmates of the fire, in it they shall abide.",,آیت الکرسی,آیت الکرسی,آیة الکرسی,आयत-उल-कुर्सी,Aayat al-Kursi,aayat_al_kursi.mp3,,,
18,Dua Abu Hamza Thumali,Abu Hamza Thumali (r.a) was a close companion of Imam Sajjad (a.s) He has related that during the month of Ramadhan Imam Sajjad (a.s) used to spend a greater part of the night in prayers and when it used to be the time of beginning of the fast he recited the following dua'a. This dua'a has been recorded in the book Misabh,"O Allah: Do not discipline me by means of Your punishment, And do not subject me to Your planned strategy . From where do I obtain the bounties, O' Lord, while none can be found except with You, And how can I seek salvation while it can be granted by none but You, Neither can the good-doer do without Your help and mercy, nor can the sinful one who offended You (when sinning), and displeased You, bypass the realm of Your power and capacity. O' my Lord, O' my Lord, O' my Lord...(repeat until out of breath) 
I knew of You by You, and You directed me to You and called me to You, and without You I would not have known what You are. All Praise is for Allah whom I call upon with my needs then He answers me, even though I was slow when He calls upon me. All Praise is for Allah whom I supplicate and He grants me (what I plead for) even though I was stingy when He sought a loan from me. 
All Praise is for Allah whom I call upon with my needs whenever I wish, and I entrust Him with my secrets without an intercessor, and He grants me my wishes. All Praise is for Allah whom I do not plead to anyone but Him, for if I pleaded to others, they would not grant me. All Praise is for Allah who dignified me by becoming the Disposer of my affairs, instead of making me rely on others who then would humiliate me. All Praise is for Allah who endeared me even though He is not in need of me. All Praise is for Allah who treats me with clemency, just as if I have no sin. So my Lord is the most praised by me of all, and most worthy of my praise. 
O' Allah! I find the roads of wishes to You wide open, And the rivers of hope to You vast and running, And counting on Your bountifulness (in times of need) for those who wished You freely accessible, And the gates of prayer to those who are disparate, wide ajar, And I know that You are for those who ask You in the position of answer, And for those who are distressed, You are in a posture of rescue. And in disparately seeking Your generosity and being content with Your judgment, I find it compensating from the rejection of the misers, and more satisfying than the handouts of the selfish. And truly traveling to You is short in duration, and You do not veil Yourself from Your creatures unless their own misdeeds would block them from You. And I have sought You for my wish, and directed my need to You, and I depend on You for my rescue, and I assign my pleading to You by praying to You, doing this while knowing that I am not worthy of Your listening to me nor do I have a right on You to pardon me, but I do so because I trust in Your generosity, and I submit to Your true promise (to answer our prayers) and I take refuge through believing in Your unity, and through my certainty of knowledge about You, that indeed I have no other god or lord but You, only You; there is no partner for You. O' my Lord! You did say and all of what You say is true and what You promise is unconditional that "" O' (believers) ask Allah of His bounty, for Allah is Merciful towards you"", And it is not from Your features, O' my Master, to order me to ask and prevent the answer, and You are the Grantor of all bounties on all residents of Your kingdom and the Giver of Your consoling tenderness. 
O' my Lord! You have brought me up in Your gifts, and bounties since I was youthful, and elevated my designation as I grew older, So, O' the One who brought me up in this life with His benevolence, bountifulness and blessings, and indicated to me His forgiveness and generosity in the hereafter. My knowledge, O' my Master, is that which guides me to You and my love is my intercessor to You, and I am trusting of my evidence with Your guidance and comfortable of my intercessor with Your intercession. I pray to You, O' my master, with a tongue that has been paralyzed by its sin, O' my Lord, I confide to You with a heart that has been doomed by its mischief; I pray to You, O' my Lord, frightened but wishful, hopeful but fearful If I contemplate my sins, O' my Lord, I become scared, but when I remember Your generosity I yearn, So, if You forgive, You are the most merciful and if You punish, You have not unjustly judged. My excuse, O' Allah in my daring to ask You, even though I have committed what You hate, is Your benevolence and generosity, and my preparation for my adversity, given that I lack shyness (in committing sin), is Your forbearance and mercy. And I am wishful that my hope will not be disappointed, so fulfill my ambition and accept my prayer, O' The Best who was ever prayed to! O' The Most bountiful who was ever wished! My hope, my Master is ever great, but my deeds have worsened, so grant me from Your pardon by as much as I had hoped, and please, do not judge me by my worst mischief, for Your generosity is greater than punishing the sinners, and Your forbearance and patience is higher than recompensing the inadequates. I am, my Master, seeking refuge through Your bountifulness, I am escaping from You to You, while anticipating Your promise to forgive those who possessed good convictions toward You. Who am I, my Lord, and what is my danger! Provide me with Your bounties and grant me charity with Your pardon, O' my Lord, cover me with Your protection and pardon me of my punishment by the honor of you face. For if any one today other than You would have known of my sin, I would not have sinned, And if I feared that You may hasten my punishment, I would have avoided sinning, Not because You are not an important watcher, nor an unworthy onlooker, but because You, my Lord, are the best secret keeper, and the Wisest of all rulers, and Most generous of all generous. O' Protector of secrets! O' Oft-forgiver of sins! O' Knower of all that is hidden! You protect the secretive sin with Your generosity and You delay my punishment with Your patience, So to You extends all the Praise for having known and yet been patient, and for having pardoned even though You are capable (of punishing). And what motivates and dares me to disobey You is Your patience with me, and what invites me to the lack of shyness (from You) is Your protection of my (concealed) sins. And what rushes me towards Your forbidden actions is my awareness of the vastness of Your mercy and the greatness of Your forgiveness. O' Forbearer! O' Generous! O' One who is living and self-subsisting! O' Forgiver of sin! O' Acceptor of repentance! O' Greatest giver of all good! O' Ancient in bountifulness! I call upon Your beautiful protection of secrets, I call upon Your abundant pardon, I call upon Your neighboring relief, I call upon Your quick rescue, I call upon Your vast mercy and compassion, I call upon Your bountiful gifts, I call upon Your blessed awards, I call upon Your splendid favors, I call upon Your immense bountifulness, I call upon Your enormous endowments, I call upon Your ancient benefaction, I call upon Your benevolence, O' Most Generous. By it (what I mentioned of Your features) I seek Your rescue, and by Your compassion, please relieve me. O' Benevolent! O' Creator of beauty! O' Benefactor! O' Bountiful! I do not depend on our (good) deeds to achieve salvation from Your punishment, rather I trust it to Your bountifulness toward us, for You are the Lord of righteousness and the Lord of forgiveness. You initiate Your giving through Your graciousness and You pardon sin with Your generosity, and we do not know what we should praise more, is it the beauties that You distribute or the sins whose secretiveness You protect, or the greatness of what You have granted and fulfilled or the many misfortunes You have averted and ills You have cured. O' The lover of whomever endeared You! O' The delight of the eye of who sought You for refuge and dedicated himself to You! You are the well doer and we are the sinners, So pardon, O' my Lord, the ugly that we have with the beauties that You have, And what ignorance, O' my Lord, can not be accommodated by Your benevolence? And what era is longer than Your patience? And what significance is our deeds compared with Your awards? And how can we hail our good deeds when we observe Your generosity? Yet how can sinners despair when they are encompassed by Your vast mercy? O' Vast Forgiver! O' Extender of both hands with mercy! I swear with Your exalted might, O' Master, that if You rebuked me, I would not depart from Your door, and I won't cease to compliment You since I have indeed come to grasp the knowledge of Your generosity and benevolence, And You are the doer of whatever You desire, You punish whomever You wish, with whatever You wish, and however You wish, and You bestow Your mercy on whomever You wish, with whatever You wish, and however You wish, You are never questioned about Your doings, neither is there any struggle in Your kingdom, nor is there any partnership in Your command, or conflict in Your judgment, and no one can oppose You in Your disposition of affairs, To You belongs all of the creation and command, Indeed Allah, the Most Glorious, is the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds. O' my Lord! This is the posture of the one who sought refuge through You and allied himself with Your generosity, and became accustomed to Your forbearance and favors, And You are the benevolent whose forgiveness is never strained, neither are Your bounties ever decreasing, nor is Your mercy ever lacking, And we have known with certainty of Your ancient pardon, great bountifulness and vast mercy, Would You, O' Allah, ever disappoint our thoughts or let down our hopes? No never, O' Most Generous! for it is not what we expect of You, nor is it what we aspire for, O' Allah, we have a greater and ever lasting hope in You, We anticipate prolonged and immense prospect in You, We anticipate great desire in You, We disobeyed You and now we wish that You protect our secret (sins), And we prayed to You and we hope You would answer us, So fulfill our aspiration, O' our Master, for otherwise, we realize (the punishment) we deserve as a result of our bad deeds, But Your awareness of our conduct and our knowledge that You indeed won't send us away from You, has motivated us to seek You, and even though we are not worthy of Your mercy, You are worthy of bestowing Your generosity on us and on all the sinners due to Your vast compassion, So, award us with what You are worthy of, and grant us for we are in need of Your bounty. O' Most Forgiving! With Your light we were guided and with Your bounties we became richer, and with Your favors we are encountered mornings and evenings, Our sins are before You and we ask You, O' Master, for forgiveness and we hereby repent, You befriend us with Your gifts but we reward You by sins, Your bounty to us is ever descending, but our mischief to You is (ever) ascending. And from before and until now, Your honored angel still brings You the news of our ugly deeds but that does not prevent You from continuing to surround us with Your grace, and kindly provide us with Your holy features. So, I glorify and praise You for the extent of Your patience, greatness and generosity as a Beginner (of creation) and eventual Claimer of this world. Holiest are Your names, And glorified is Your praise, And honored are Your favors and good deeds. 
You, my Lord, are more vast in bounty and greater in patience and clemency than to judge me according to my wrong doing and fault, So I beg You : Forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness, O' my Master, O' my Master, O' my Master. O' Lord! Occupy our time with Your remembrance, And guard us from Your wrath, And protect us from Your punishment, And grant us from Your rewards, And award us from Your bounties, And provides us the means to conduct pilgrimage to Your house (Ka'ba), and to visit the tomb of Your Prophet, may Your peace, mercy, forgiveness and graciousness be bestowed upon him and his family, Indeed, You are close and forthcoming with Your answer (to our prayers). And assist us in abiding by Your obedience, and claim our souls while we are in Your (righteous) congregation and followers of the tradition of Your Prophet, may peace of Allah be upon him and his family. O' Lord! Forgive me and my parents and grant them mercy as they have raised me since I was youthful, reward their good deeds with bountifulness and (pardon) their sins with forgiveness. O' Lord! Forgive the believers, be they men or women, living or dead, and let us follow on their path with good deeds. O' Lord! Forgive (for) the living or deceased of us, (believers) the present and the absent, our male and female, our young and old, our free and our slave, Indeed the antagonists of Allah lied and enormously wandered astray, and incurred a major loss. O' Lord! Bestow Your peace on Muhammad and his family, and conclude my life in virtue, and resolve what worries me from the affairs of this life and in the hereafter, and do not allow anyone who won't treat me justly to come in contact with me, and provide me with Your everlasting protection and do not deprive me of the best of the amenities. You graced me with, and confer on me from Your bounties, vast awards that are lawful and good. O' Lord! Guard me with Your safeguard, And protect me with Your protection, And ally me with Your alliance, And award me the ability to conduct pilgrimage to Your sacred house (Ka'ba) in this year and in every year, and to visit the tomb of Your prophet and the Imams, peace be upon them, and do not deprive me, Oh Lord, from visiting these honorable sanctuaries and noble positions. O' Lord! Accept my repentance so that I may not disobey You, And inspire me with righteousness and its implementation, And the observance of Your presence in the night and the day as long as You let me live, O' Allah and Cherisher of the worlds. O' Lord! I, whenever I thought I was prepared and ready and rose to pray, before Your hands, and confided to You, You cast sleep on me when I prayed, and You prevented me from confiding to You when I confided, Why is it that whenever I felt content about the goodness of my core, and my companionships have neared that of the repentants, a sin would occur and cause my feet to stumble, and deprive me from Your service, O' my Master, Maybe You have expelled me from Your door, and retired me from Your service, or maybe You observed my disregard of Your right on me and thus distanced me, or maybe You saw me headed away from (Your path) and thus You withdrew me, or maybe You found me to be in the position of the liars so You rejected me, or maybe You saw that I was not grateful of Your rewards so You deprived me, or maybe You observed my absence from the assembly of the scholars and thus put me down, or maybe You found me to be one of the unheeding so You despaired me from Your mercy, or maybe You found me frequenting the assembly of the unfaithful, so between me and them You deserted me, or maybe You did not like to listen to my prayers so You distanced me, or maybe You equated me with my crime and sin, or maybe You punished me for my lack of shyness from You. So if You forgive, O' Lord, You have forgiven the many sinners before me. For Your generosity, O' Lord, is higher than punishing the delinquents, and I am seeking refuge with Your bountifulness, and I am escaping from You to You, and anticipating Your promise to pardon those who possessed good convictions about You. O' My Lord! You are more vast in bountifulness and greater in patience than to judge me according to my deed, or to stumble me with my sin. And who am I, my Master, and what is my danger? award me Your benevolence, O' my Master! And render me Your pardon, and cover me with the protection of my secrets, and pardon me from Your chastisement with Your benevolent face. O' Master! I am the young one whom You raised, And I am the ignorant whom You educated, And I am the misled whom You guided, And I am the humiliated one whom You elevated, And I am the frightened one whom You safeguarded, And the hungry one whom You fed, And the thirsty whose thirst You quenched, And the naked whom You dressed, And the poor whom You made wealthy, And the weak whom You strengthened, And the insignificant whom You honored, And the sick whom You cured, And the beggar whom You provided charity to, And the sinner whose secret You have protected, And the wrong doer whom You aided, And I am the little (creature) You made more significant, And the oppressed whom You made victorious, And I am the escapee whom You gave refuge to, I am the one, O' Allah, who did not revere You (when I committed sins) in my seclusions, nor observed Your (commands) in public, I am the possessor of the great craftiness (bad intentions), I am the one who dared His Master, I am the one who disobeyed the Commander of the skies, I am the one who awarded the briberies upon the disobeying of the Magnificent (Allah), I am the one who when I was forewarned about it (sins), I hastily raced to it, I am the one whom You awaited (His reverence) but I did not comprehend, and You veiled my secret (sins) but I did not become demure, and I committed sins until I belligerently insisted, and You then disregarded me but I did not care, but with Your benevolence, You postponed my punishment, and with Your veil, You safeguarded my secret (sins) as if You have overlooked me, and You shielded me from punishment called upon me by my sins all to the extent that it appeared as if You shied off from me. O' my Lord! I did not disobey You when I did because I rejected Your divinity, or because I belittled Your commands, or that I was daringly challenging Your punishment, or that I did not appreciate Your forewarning, Yet the mistake has occurred, and my self misled me, and my sinful desires won over me, and my misery helped me to it, and Your protective veil over my sins lured me, For I have disobeyed You and opposed You with my own will, and now from Your retribution who would rescue me, and from the hands of Your angels of punishment tomorrow (in the hereafter), who would redeem me, and with whose rope do I hold on to if You cut off Your rope from me, so what a pity for what Your book has recorded on me, Indeed, if it was not for my anticipation of Your generosity and vast mercifulness as well as Your ordering me not to lose hope (in Your salvation) that I would have despaired whenever I remembered it (my sin). O' the Best of whom a worshiper has ever prayed, and the Foremost of whom anyone has wished! O' Lord! In the name of the esteemed Islam, I implore You, And with the holy Qur'an I take witness to You, And with my love for the unschooled Prophet (Muhammad) The Quraishian (the main tribe in Mecca) The Hashimite (The family name of Prophet Muhammad), The Arabian, The Tuhamian (the name of the region where Quraish is located) The Meccan, The Medinan (tracing prophet Muhammad's roots to the city of Medina where He migrated to), I seek to be closer to You (I seek favor to You) So please do not disrupt the serenity of my faith, And please do not cause my ultimate destiny to be similar to that of those who worshipped other than You. For, indeed there are some who believed only to the extent of their tongues so that they may save their lives and they gathered what they wished, But we have believed in You with our tongues and with our hearts so that You may pardon us, So grant us what we wish for, And anchor our hope in You, in our hearts, And do not let our hearts go astray after You have guided us, And grant us Your mercy, Indeed You are the Utmost Granter. And I swear with Your glory, that even if You send me away that I would not depart from Your door, and I would not cease to compliment You, for my heart has been fully inspired with the knowledge of Your benevolence and vastness of compassion. To where would a slave go but to his master, To where would a creature seek refuge but to his Creator. O' my Lord! Even if You tied me with the chains of hell, And You deprived me Your flowing stream (of favors) from between the witnesses (of the day of Judgment), And You pointed out my scandals to the eyes of Your worshipers, And You ordered me to hell, And You isolated me from the company of the faithfuls, I would not end my hope in You, and I would not dismiss my reassurance of Your pardon, and my love to You would not depart from my heart, I do not forget the helping hand You bestowed upon me, and Your protection of my secrets in life.
O' my Master! Remove the adoration of worldliness from my heart, And unite me with Mustafa (Muhammad: the chosen messenger) and his family, the dearest of Your creatures and the last of the prophets, Muhammad, Peace from Allah upon him and his family, And transfer me to the level of repentance to You, And help me to cry for myself for I have wasted my life away with procrastination and false hopes, And now I have come to You hopeless of my goodness, Who is more worse off than me, if now I am passed on in my present state to a grave that I have not prepared for my repose and I did not line with good deeds for my drowse, And why would I not weep for I have no knowledge of my fate and I observe my self deceiving itself, and my days are fading away, and the wings of death have flapped close by, So why wouldn't I cry! I cry for surrendering my life, I cry because of the darkness of my grave, I cry because of the narrowness of my grave, I cry for the questioning of Munkar and Nakeer of me (the names of the two angels that question the dead after being laid in the graves), I cry from my leaving my grave (in the hereafter) naked, humiliated and carrying my book (of deeds) on my back, I look to the right once and to the left once and I discover that people today have other concern than mine, for every person that day has a concern of his own, some faces today are bright, laughing and joyful, while other faces that day are dusty, loaded with submission and humility. O' Master! I settle my destination, dependence, hope and reliance upon You, And with Your mercy, I cling; You bestow Your mercy on whomever You please and You guide with Your benevolence whomever You like, So praise to You for Your purifying my heart from taking false partners to You, And praise to You for releasing my tongue, Is it with this heavy tongue of mine I thank You or with the utmost effort of mine do I satisfy You? And what is the value of my tongue, O' Lord, when it comes to thanking You? And what is the value of my good deeds beside Your gifts and fortitude with me? O' my Lord! Indeed Your generosity has expanded my hope (in You), And your acceptance has led to the taking of my deed. O' my Master! To You I direct my aim, fear, and meditation, And my hope has driven me to You, And on You O' Mighty One, I concentrate my initiative, And upon what You possess I unfolded my desire, And my ultimate hope and fear rest upon You, And with You, I cheerfully contemplated Your adoration And I spread my hands wide open to You, And with the rope of Your obedience I eased my fear. O' my Lord! In Your remembrance, my heart flourished, And in confiding to You, I relieved my pain of fright. So, O' my Lord! And O' the One whom I hope! And O' the One who is the Ultimate Destination and Grantor of my request! Separate between me and this sin of mine that disables me from abiding by Your obedience, For I only ask You due to the ancient and long resting of hope upon You as well as the great coveting of You, in what You obliged yourself with from compassion and mercy. Evidently, the command is yours, for You are the only One without partners, and all creatures are in Your maintenance and within Your grip, and everything submits to You, blessed You are O' Lord and Cherisher of the worlds. O' my Lord! Bestow Your mercy upon me when my excuses have failed and when my tongue has ceased to be able to answer to You (on judgment day) and my intellect has subsided upon Your questioning, So O' to whom I submit my utmost hope, do not disappoint me when my tragedy has intensified, and do not reject me due to my ignorance and conceit, and do not deprive me (Your mercy) due to my lack of patience, and provide for me for I am poor, and bestow Your mercy upon me for I am weak. O' my Master! Upon You I rest my dependence, destination, hope and reliance, And with Your mercy I cling, And on Your grounds, I conclude my journey, And to Your generosity I direct my request, And with Your generosity, O' Allah, I commence my prayer, And with You I seek relief from my indigence, And with Your wealth I mend my poverty, And under the shadow of Your pardon, I stand, And to Your generosity and benevolence, I raise my eyesight, And to Your favor, I prolong my vision, So, burn me not in the hell fire because You are where I place my hope, And, reside me not in the bottomless pit (hell) for You are indeed the comfort of my eye. O' my Master! Disappoint not my expectation in Your benevolence and known favor because You are my Confidant and Security, And do not deprive me of Your reward for You are Aware of my poverty. O' my Lord! If the end of my life has neared and my deeds did not bring me near You, then I hereby render my admission of sin as my justification. O' my Lord! If You pardon (me), then no one is more worthy of pardoning than You, And if You punish (me), then no one is more just than You in judgment, 
(O' Lord) have mercy toward my expatriation in this life, and my tragedy upon death, and my solitude in the grave, and my loneliness in the grave, and because whenever I am dispatched for judgment before Your hands, my situation is humiliated, and forgive what is concealed from the humans of my (secretive bad) deeds, and prolong for me what You veiled my (secret sins) with, and confer Your benevolence on me when I am (laying) motionless on the (death) bed so that the beloved of my relatives surround me, and grant me Your bountifulness when I am stretched on the funeral bath so that the good-deeded of my community may wash me, and bestow Your kindred tenderness upon me when I am carried while my relatives hand over the extremities of my coffin, and award me Your generosity when I am transported and finally delivered and left alone in my grave, and have mercy on my solitary confinement in this new residence so that I may not be comforted by anyone but You. O' my Master! If You entrusted me (with my affairs), I would perish My Master, then whom do I seek rescue with if You would not avert my stumble, To whom would I seek shelter with if I lost Your kindred care in my dormancy, To whom would I resort to if You did not relieve my destitution. My Master! Who will be on my side and who will bestow mercy on me if You do not? And whose bounties would I anticipate if I lacked Your grants on the day of my destitution (judgment day)? And to where shall I run away from my sins when my fate is concluded? My Master! Punish me not while I am pleading to You! O' my Lord! Fulfill my desire and secure my fright because I can not avert (the result of) my numerous sins except with Your pardon.
My Master! I am asking You for what I do not deserve, but You are the Lord of righteousness and the Lord of forgiveness, So, forgive for me and veil me from Your sight with a cloak that masks all my liabilities, thus forgiving me so that I may never be reclaimed with it, Indeed, You are the possessor of ancient favor, great pardon and generous forgiveness. O' my Lord! You are the One who overflows the streams (of favors) on those who do not even implore You and on those who rejected Your divinity, So how would You not, O' Master, grant the same to the one who implored You and submitted with certainty that the creation is yours and the command is to You? Praised and glorified You are, O' Lord and Cherisher of the worlds. O' my Master! Your slave is at Your doorstep. His desperate need has rooted him before Your hands. He knocks on the gate of Your generosity with his prayer, and he solicits Your gracious consideration (in relieving his dilemma) through his hearty anticipation (in You), So please do not turn Your honorable face away from me and accept from me what I plead for, For I have pleaded with this prayer and I am hopeful that You would not turn me down, since I have always known of Your benevolence and mercy. 
O' my Lord! You are the one who is never burdened by the pleas of the beseecher, nor are You ever encumbered in rewarding (Your) grantee, Verily, You are how You describe Yourself and above what we describe. O' my Lord! I ask You (to grant me) a rewarding patience, a neighboring relief, a true affirmation, and a great reward; I ask You, O' my Lord, for all the good whether I know of it or not, I ask You, O' my Lord, for the best of what have asked You Your righteous believers. O' the Foremost of whom was ever asked! and the Most Generous that has ever given, Fulfill my quest in myself, my family, parents, children, proximate community, and my brothers (and sisters) in You, And enrich my living, and ascend my bravery and improve all of my affairs, And cause me to be a (person) whom You have destined to have prolonged his life, and improved his deeds, and consummated Your gifts upon him, and accepted his performance, and made live a good life in permanent joy utmost integrity, and complete living, Indeed, You do as You please, and not as others please. O' Lord! Distinguish me with Your distinctive remembrance, And do not allow any of what I seek closeness to You with (of good deeds), in the midst of nights or the extremes of days, to be an object of pretension, seeking of reputation, arrogance, or extravagance. And cause me to be of those who humble themselves to You.
O' my Lord! Award me vastness in sustenance, And security in my homeland, And the comfort of the eye in family, finances and offspring, And the continued enjoyment of Your bounties, And health and strength in the body, And safeguard in faith, And forever utilize me in (establishing) Your obedience and that of Prophet Muhammad peace of Allah upon him and his household, as everlong as You advance my age, And compel me to have the biggest share among Your worshipers in whatever good You ever caused to descend and especially what You award in the month of Ramadan, in the Night of the Decree, and what You are awarding every year from mercy that You dispense, and good health that You harness, and crises that You deter, and good deeds that You accept and bless, and sins that You acquit. And allot me with the ability to conduct pilgrimage to Your holy house in this year and every year thereafter, And grant me vast sustenance from Your vast bounties, And protect me, O' my Master, from encountering the misfortunes (of life) And fulfill on my behalf all my borrowing and satisfy any injustice (I committed to others) so that I may not be harmed by any of it, And preoccupy the hearing and sight of my enemies and the jealous and those who oppress me and award me victory over them, And comfort my eye, And delight my heart, And award me relief and resolution in all of my misfortunes and extremities, And compel any one who wishes me harm from all Your creatures, to be beneath my feet, And guard me from the evil of Satan and the evil of the monarch as well as the evil brought about by my wrong doings, And cleanse me from all sins, And salvage me from the hell fire with Your (divine) pardon, And award me paradise with Your mercy, And marry me to the companions with the beautiful, big and lustrous eyes with Your bountifulness, And reunite me with Your righteous servants Muhammad and his household, the righteous, the virtuous, the pure and the elite, Your peace, mercy and blessings be upon them, their bodies, and their souls.
O' my Lord and my Master! I swear with Your exalted might and majesty that if You reclaim my sins that I will call upon Your mercy, and if You reclaim my meanness, I will call upon Your generosity, and if You forward me to the hell fire, I will inform its inmates about my adoration of You. O' my Lord and my Master! If You were to not forgive but Your devotees and constant obeyers, then to whom would the sinners resort to? And if You were to not honor but the people of loyalty to You, then to whom the offenders would resort to? O' my Lord! If You cause me to enter the hell fire, it will be to the pleasure of Your enemy, But if You cause me to enter paradise, it will be to the pleasure of Your Prophet, And verily, Oh Allah, I know that the pleasure of Your Prophet is more favorable to You than the pleasure of Your enemy. O' my Lord! I ask You to saturate my heart with Your love, fearing and observing You, believing in Your (holy) book, faith in You, fright from You, and longing to You. O' the one who is full of majesty, bounty and honor! Render me loving of Your meeting and love my meeting, And grant me in meeting You comfort, happiness and honor. O' my Lord! Unite me with the virtuous of those who preceded me, And render me to be among the virtuous of who remained, And lead me to the way of the virtuous, And aid me in restraining myself (from sin) with whatever You aid Your righteous believers with, And culminate my deeds with their best, And make my reward from it heaven with Your mercy, And assist me in implementing the virtues that You granted me, And anchor me (on the right path) O' Lord! And return me not to an error You rescued me from before, O' the Lord and Cherisher of the worlds! O' my Lord! I ask You to grant me a faith that has no maturity until I meet You, Prolong my life as long as You maintain me on it, and claim my soul as long as You claim my soul while it is on it (faith), and resurrect me as long as You resurrect me on it; And purify my heart from pretension, doubt, and seeking reputation through Your religion so that all my deeds would be solely intended for You. O' my Lord! Award me insight in Your religion And understanding in Your judgment, And awareness in Your knowledge, And surety in Your mercy And piety that shields me from committing sin, And brighten my face with Your light, And render my affinity solely in what You possess, And claim my soul on Your path and on the religion of Your Prophet, Peace of Allah upon him and his household. O' my Lord! I seek refuge with You from laziness, failure, misery, cowardliness, stinginess, unawareness, cruelty, humility, poverty, indigence and every calamity; and the exorbitant of sins whether they are apparent or concealed, And I seek refuge in You from a self that is never content, and a stomach that is never satisfied, and a heart that is never pious, and a prayer that is not accepted, and a deed that is not beneficial (if committed). And I depend upon You O' Lord, to safeguard my self, my religion, my finances, and all of what You awarded me, from the evil of the cursed Satan; Indeed, You are the One who hears and knows all things. O' my Lord! Indeed no one can shield me from Your (punishment) and I can not find before You any other shelter, So leave not in me any deed worthy of Your punishment and lead me not back into jeopardy and lead me not into painful retribution. O' my Lord! Accept my prayer And renown my commemoration, And elevate my degree, And forgive my sin. And remember me not with my bad deed, And culminate the reward of my convening, my speaking, and my prayer in Your satisfaction and heaven. And award me, O' Lord, all of what I asked You and increase it with Your bountifulness; Indeed, I am truly full of desire toward You, O' Lord and Cherisher of the worlds. O' my Lord! You have revealed in Your (holy) book for us to forgive those who committed injustice toward us, and we have committed injustice (by sinning) toward ourselves so pardon our conduct, for You are more worthy of pardoning than we are; And You commanded us not turn away the needy who knock on our doors, and I hereby come to You needy, so turn me not away until You fulfill my need; And You commanded us to treat justly those whose freedom reins we hold, and You hold our reins of freedom, so liberate our necks from the hell fire. O' the Shelter I seek whenever I am in misfortune! O' my Guardian from my hardship! To You I resort, and with You I appealed for help and sought refuge, And I would never seek anyone but You, nor would I ever request relief but from You, So come to my aid, and relieve me. O' One who liberates the captives, accepts the little (of good deeds), and pardons the numerous (of sin), accept from me the little (good) I have done, and forgive for me the numerous (sins I have committed); Indeed, You are the Most Merciful and Oft-forgiving. O' my Lord! I ask You to grant me a faith that You endure my heart on, And a true certainty in believing so that I may ascertain that indeed nothing will happen to me except for what You have destined for me, And award me contentment in my presiving (and circumstances) with whatever You have apportioned for me, O' the Most Merciful of the mercifuls.

19,Dua Adeela,"This dua'a contains the articles of faith. Every faithful must recite this dua'a regularly to drive away Shaytan, and to remain firm in the true faith. A dying faithful, in the last moments of life, should recite this dua'a, or , if it is not possible, ask someone else to read it aloud for him or her, so as not to be misled by doubts which may come into the mind, or not to be depressed emotionally, because these forces together with the misleading suggestions of Shaytan, more often than not, in the last hour of life, make man die a death of an infidel or hypocrite.","Allah (Himself) is witness that there is no god but He.
The angles and the men of wisdom, standing firm for justice (too are witness).
That there is no god but He, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Verily, religion with Allah is Islam.
And I, a timid servant, sinful, guilty, insignificant, needy, destitute, give witness of my Benefactor, my creator, my Sustainer, and my liberal patron, just as He Himself testifies, and testify the Angles and the men of wisdom, His servants, that verily there is no god but He, Possessor of bounties and favours, generosity and blessings.
Eternal almighty, Ever-lasting, knower, One and only Ever-living, Ever-existing, Hearer, seer, willing, discriminating, Aware, Independent. Worthy is He of these attributes, although, truly speaking, He is over and above attribution. He was Almighty prior to the actuality of might and power was created. He was wise before the conception of knowledge and reason was brought about. He was Absolute Sovereign even when there was no kingdom or possession. He is Glory under al circumstances. His supreme Being is prior to antecedence, and Eternal, without a beginning. He will survive continually beyond the end of everything, imperishable, and without an end. He has no needs; in the beginning as well as in the end. He is able free from dependence, by Himself, whether inward, or outward, There is no injustice in His Judgment, no unfairness in His management, no oppression in His administration. 
(It is) impossible to deny His Sovereignty, or to run away from His firm grip, or to avoid His punishment. His mercy overtakes his anger. If a (handicapped) person asks for anything from Him, unable to approach Him (properly) on account of frustrating trouble, he is treated in the matter of fulfillment at par with an able beseecher. He has given capacity to carry out (His) commands, has made it easy to avoid (His ) prohibitions and has not made obedience cumbersome but according to one’s competency. 
Glory be to he! How much kind is He! Highest is His glory. Glory be to He! How wonderful His gifts! And certainly his favours are countless. He sent down Prophets to explain clearly His justice, appointed guides to make known his power and generosity, and put us among the ummah (followers) of the Prophet-in-chief, the closest friend of Allah, the superlative being, and the most pious, Muhammad, Allah’s blessings and peace be on him and on his descendants. 
We paid attention to him, believed in what he said, and in the Holy Quran, Thou revealed to him, and in his successor Ali, appointed by him on the day of Ghadeer, and identified in clear words: “This is Ali”. I testify that there are pious Imams and righteous successors, after the chosen Messenger , from Ali, the subduer of infidels. After him, his eldest son, Hasan bin Ali, thereafter his brother, Husayn, the grandson of the Messenger of Allah, obedience unto whom is the will of Allah; then Ali, the adorer of Allah (A’abid), then Muhammad, the treasure of knowledge (Baaqir), then Ja’far, the truthful (S’aadiq), then Moosa the sagacious (Kaaz’im), then Ali the devoted (Riz’aa), then Muhammad the pious (Taqiyy), then Ali the (Naqiyy), then Hasan the gatherer (A’skariyy), then, the awaited saviour, evident argument and established successor, my hope, because of hose perpetuity, the world is going on; because of whose blessings all living beings get their daily bread, because of whose presence, the heaven and the earth stay stable; and through him Allah will fill the earth with equity and justice, when it is run over with tyranny and oppression. 
I bear witness that their words are decisive arguments; to follow their example is obligatory, to obey them is compulsory, to love them is necessary (because it has been) preordained, to take after them is sure salvation, to oppose them is certain destruction. They are the chiefs of the people of paradise, effective helpers on the Dayof Judgment, the best guides for the mankind, surely the best approved successors. I testify that death is certain, interrogation in the grave is certain, raising of the dead is certain, Siraat (the bridge over hell) is certain, Meezan (trail) is certain, Hisaab (accountability) is certain, The Book (Holy Quraan) is true, paradise is real, Hell is real, and certainly there is no doubt in the hour of resurrection. Verily Allah shall raise the dead from their graves. 
O Allah! I hope to receive Thy favour, Thy generosity and mercy I expect for getting into paradise, for my conduct gives me no right, for obtaining Thy bliss as I was not obedient, except that I believe Thy Oneness, and Thy Justice. I depend upon Thy favours, and Thy generosity. Accommodated me for the sake of my Prophet and his progeny, Thy beloved friends. Thou art the most Generous, the most Merciful. O Allah send blessings on the best creature, Muhammad, and on his pious and pure progeny. There is no authority and no might except Allah’s, the High, the Great. (All) praise is for Allah, the lord of the worlds. My Allah! O the most Merciful, I deposit my beliefs and religion with Thee as a Trust, Thou art the best of all trustees, We have been commanded to preserve that which is entrusted to us, so give back (what I have deposited now) at the time of my death and when “Mankar and Nakeer” will question me, for the sake of Muhammad and his pure and pious progeny, through Thy Mercy, O the Most Merciful.",,دعاء العديلة,دعای عدیله,دُعاءُ الْعَديلة,दुआ अदीला,Dua Adeela,Adeela.mp3,,urdu_adeelah,7.0
20,Dua Jawshan Kabeer," It has been mentioned in the book, Balad al-Amin and the Misbah of Kafa`mi that Imam `Ali ibn al-Husain Sayyid as-Sajjidin (prayers be upon him) related from his father from his grandfather the Prophet of Allah (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) that this supplication was taught by the Angel Jibra’il (prayers be upon him) to the Prophet (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) during one of the battles.It was in one of the wars that the Prophet (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) had taken part in which he had a very heavy and expensive coat of armor on to protect himself. It is related that the coat was so heavy that it was hurting the body of the Prophet (prayers of Allah be upon him and his family). In this state,the Angel Jibra’il (prayers be upon him) came to the Prophet (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) and said: “O’ Muhammad! Your Lord conveys his salutations to you and has said to take this coat of armor (Jawshan) and to recite it as this is a protection for you and your Ummah.","In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful.

","Allah! I beseech Thee through Thy Name, the most great, the most majestic, the most magnificent and the most noble. 
If Thou art requested therewith to open the closed doors of the sky these will open with Thy mercy. If Thou art requested thereby to remove the narrowness of the doors of the heaven, they will be opened wide. If Thou art requested thereby to make easy the difficulty, it will be easy. 
If Thou art requested thereby to restore the dead to life, they will wise from their graves. If Thou art requested thereby to remove misery and adversity, they will be removed. I beseech Thee through the Majesty of Thy person, the Most Generous and the Most Honoured One, before Whom everybody bows down in submission and all necks bend down in reverence and through fear of Whom all voices become humbled and all hearts tremble; and I beseech Thee through Thy Might, which prevents the sky from falling on the earth except with Thy permission, and which controls all the heavens and the earth so closely that they cannot move away from their positions; and I beseech Thee through they Will, which the whole world obeys, and through Thy Word. 
By which Thou hath created the heaven and the earth, and through Thy Wisdom, with which Thou hath created wonderful, and with which Thou created Darkness and made it Night, and made night the time of quiet and rest; and with which Thou created Light and made it Day, and made day the time of movement and observation; and with which Thou hath created the Sun, and made the sun of light. 
And with which Thou hath created the Moon, and made the moon of light; and with which Thou hath created heavenly bodies, and made them fixed stars and planets, and lamps for guidance at night, and as a means of decoration, and missiles for driving away the devils, and hath created for them east and west, and hath created for them the places of ascendancy and orbits, and created for them a firmament and sphere, and fixed for them stages in the heave - and how beautiful the stages - and shaped the stars - and how beautiful the shapes - and made them stable through Thy Name; and Thy Wisdom Thou designed a system for them - and what a good system, and controlled the heavenly bodies through the king of the night and the king of day, and through hours, making them a means for the reckoning of years and counting, making appearance of heavenly bodies regular and universal. 
And I beseech Thee, O Allah, through Thy Glory, with which Thou addressed Thy slave and Thy Messenger, Moses son of 'Imran peace be on him, while he was in the company of angels - which address even the favourite cherubin could not ever hear, above the clouds of light, above the box of evidence, with in the pillar of fire on Mount Sinai, and on Mount Hurith in the Holy Vale in the sacred tract of land to the right of Taurus Mountain-through a tree; and again addressed him on the soil of Egypt, after showing nine clear signs and on the day Thou split the sea for the Children of Israel, and caused springs to flow from a stone, thereby displaying wonders of Thy might in a deep sea; and on the day when Thou solidified the water of the sea in the midst of the storm, and caused the Children of Israel to pass by it, and fulfilled Thy excellent promises made to them because of their calmly endurance, and made them the master of the East and the West in the earth, wherein there are blessings for all the worlds; and Thou drowned Pharaoh and his armies and boats in the water.
And (I beseech Thee) through Thy name, which is the most great, the most majestic, and the most holy; and through Thy glory, with which Thou revealed light to Moses, Thy addressee, peace be on him, on Mount Sinal; and earlier radiated the light for Abraham, Thy sincere friend peace be on him, in the mosque of al-Khayf; and for Isaac, Thy chosen Prophet, peace be on him, in Bi-ri shiay', and for Thy Prophet Jacob, peace be on him, in Bayt iil and through Thy Glory, with which Thou fulfilled Thy promise to Abraham, peace be on him; and through Thy Oath in favour of Isaac; and through Thy witnessing favouring Jacob; and through the fulfillments of Thy promise to the faithful: and through Thy Names with which Thou accepted the prayers of supplications; and through Thy Glory, which appeared to Moses, son of Imran, in Qubbat al-Rumman; and through Thy Signs, which appeared on the soil of Egypt with great might and victory, with powerful signs and with the display of full command and great power; and with the affair of the perfect word; and with Thy words with which Thou doth a favor for the people of the skies and the earth and the people of here and the hereafter; and through Thy Mercy with which Thou bestowth upon all Thy creatures: and through thy Power with which Thou dominateth the worlds; and (I beseech Thee) through Thy Light, through fear of which Mount Sinai collapsed, through Thy Knowledge, and Thy Greatness and Majesty, and Thy Unique Magnificence and Thy honour, and (through) Thy might, which the earth could not bear, and, for which the heavens and earth bent down, and the great depths restrained themselves, and the seas and rivers became stable, and to which the mountains made submission, and due to which the earth became firm on its shoulders, and to which all creatures submitted, and due to which the winds breathed, and the flaming fires were extinguished in their places. 
And I beseech Thee through Thy might, through which Thou hath been known to be All-powerful for ever and ever, and for which Thou hath been praised in the heavens and the earth; and I beseech Thee through Thy word, the Word of Truth, which became a blessing for our father Adam and his generation; and I beseech Thee through Thy word, by which Thou overcame everything; and I beseech thee through the light of Thy Face, which when it flased on Mount Sinai crushed it to pieces, whereby Moses fainted and fell down, and through Thy Glory, which appeared on Mount Sinai, and through which Thou addressed Thy slave and Thy Mesenger; Moses, son of 'Imran, and through Thy appearance in Sa'ir and on Mount Faran near Rabawat, which are clean and holy places, when troops of heavenly angels were in rows, and with the sumissiveness of the angels praising Thee, and with Thy blessings with which Thou honoured Abraham, Thy sincere friend, peace be upon him, among the followers of Muhammad, Thy blessings be upon him and his Progeny and Thou honoured Isaac, Thy chosen prophet, among the followers of Jesus, peace be on them both, and honoured Jacob, Thy favoured slave, by including him among the followers of Moses, peace be on them both, and honoured Thy intimate friend Muhammad, may the blessings of Allah be upon him and his Progeny, and peace be upon his offspring and seed, and his people. O Allah! Just as we believe in the turth and justice of these manifestations of Thy glory, without having been present at the time, and without having been eyewitnesses. So we beseech Thee to send Thy blessings upon Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad, and honour Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhamamd, and honour Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad and have mercy on Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad, with the blessings, honour, and mercy Thou sent and bestowed on and meted out to Abraham and the posterity of Abraham. Surely Thou art Praiseworthy, Glorious, the Doer of what Thou willeth. Thou art Powerful over all things. 
Now express your desire and beseech Allah to fulfill it. Then recite the following.
O Allah! For the sake of this prayer, and for the sake of these Names which no one can interpret, the inner meaning of which no one other than Thyself knows. Send Thy blessing upon Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad; and give me the good of here and the hereafter; and do to me what suits Thee and do not do to me what I deserve and exact vengeance from…(enemy of progeny of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), and forgive my sins past and future, and forgive my parents and all faithful men and women, and increase Thy lawful sustenance for me, and save me from the help of wicked men, wicked neighbours, wicked rulers, wicked companions, and evil days and hours, and exact vengeance for me on everyone who hatches secret plots against me, and on everyone who oppresses me and seeks to do injustice to me or my wife or my children or my brothers or my neighbours or my relations among faithful men and women. Verily Thou art able to do whatever Thou wileth, and Thou knowest everything. Amen, O Lord of the worlds. 
O Allah! For the sake of this prayer, grant wealth and affluence to indigent faithful men and women, and recovery and sound health to the sick faithful men and women, and bliss and clemency to the living faithful men and women, and remit the sins of, and have mercy on, the deceased faithful men and women, and arrange the return home of all faithful travellers with safety and gain. Through Thy mercy, O Most Merciful of all the merciful. May Allah's blessings and peace in abundant measure be upon our master Muhammad, the last of the prophets, and his Progeny, the purified.",,دعائے سمات,دعای سمات,دُعاءُ السّماتِ,दुआ सिमात (समात),Dua Simaat (Samat),simaat.mp3,,urdu_samaat,10.0
22,Dua Mujeer,"This is a supplication of high eminence which is reported to have been brought by Jibreel for the Holy Prophet (pbuh) when he was engrossed in prayers in Maqam-e-Ibrahim. Kafa'ami has reported this supplication in Baladul Amin and in Misbah. It is mentioned by him that the reward for the one reciting it during the nights of full moon (13th, 14th & 15th) of the Holy month of Ramadan, is that his sins are forgiven even if they are in such plenty as the drops of rain water, leaves of trees or sand of a desert. It is also very effective for the cure of the sick, fulfillment of debts, acquisition of wealth and relief from sorrows.","Glory be to Thee. O Allah! besought art Thou, with Thy praise. O Beneficent!

23,Dua Yastasheer,"Ibna tawus in his book Muhaj al Dawat and Kafami in his book Misbah narrate this dua'a on the authority of Imam Ali ibna abi Talib who learned it from the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet advised him to recite this dua'a regularly, whether in prosperity or poverty, till death, because it unveils the secretes of creation and divine strategy. Words can not describe its merits. Intelligent can not describe its meanings. No sooner someone begins to recite it, Almighty Allah send blessings, and his mercy surrounds him, peace and tranquillity descend upon him. The sound of this dua'a moves to and from around the arsh, its direct destination. All his desired are fulfilled. His needs are taken care of. He gets freedom from wants and is kept safe from hardships and misfortunes. His mind opens up new dimensions of contemplation. On the day of judgement he will be received by Allah with respect and honour. 
It cures insanity if recited before a mad man. It relives pain of childbirth if recited before the expectant mother.
It recited on forty Fridays consecutively all sins are forgiven. It cures sickness and disperses sorrows. For him who recites it before going to sleep Allah appoints one thousand angels to pray for him till morning. He who recites it and dies within 24 hours it treated like a martyr.
 This supplication is recommended for the removal of all troubles and worries, and it is recommended that it be performed with ablution. It is narrated that it was taught to the first Imam, ‘Ali, peace be upon him, by the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his Progeny.
","All praise is due to Allah. There is no god but He, the Living, the Just, the Manifest. 
He is the Administrator without any minister and without consultation with any of his slaves. He is the First, who cannot be described. 
He is Eternal and will live forever, (even) after the annihilation of all creatures. 
He is the greatest Cherisher and Sustainer and the Light of the earths and heavens and their Creator and Maker out of nothing. 
He created both of them and separated them - a proper separation. The heavens became stable in obedience to His commandment and the earths became fixed on the surface of the water with their pegs. 
Then our Lord the All-Merciful subdued the high heavens and ruled from the Throne. 
Everything that is in heaven and in the earth and in between them and what is below the earth belongs to Him. So, I bear witness that verily You are Allah. 
There is none to elevate what You hath lowered and no one to exalt him whom You leaves in disgrace and no one to bring into disgrace him whom You exalts and no one to prevent him upon whom You bestoweth Thy favour and no one to bestow anything, which You hath withheld. You are Allah, there is no god but Thee. Who existed when there was neither the stable sky nor the broad earth nor the brilliant sun nor the dark night, nor the bright day, nor the vast and stormy sea, nor any sublime and stable mountain, nor any revolving planet, nor the luminous moon, nor any blowing wind, nor any raining cloud, nor flashing lightning, nor any praising thunder, nor any breathing soul, nor any flying bird, nor any blazing fire, nor any flowing water. 
You existed before the existence of everything and You created everything and controlled everything and originated everything. 
You enriched some and reduced others to poverty, caused some to die and brought others to life, and made some people glad and other weep. Verily You rules from the Throne. 
You are of vast blessing, O Allah You are Great and Supreme. You are Allah and there is no god other than Thee. 
You are the Creator and Supporter. 
Thy Decree is everpowering and Thy Knowledge is operative. Thy strategy is wonderful; Thy promise is true; Thy word is right; Thy command is just; Thy utterance is right guidance; Thy Revelation is light; Thy mercy is vast and abundant; Thy forgiveness is superb; Thy grace is excessive; Thy gift is most respectable Thy cord is strong; Thy might is ever ready Thy protégé is powerful; Thy wrath is severe; and Thy stratagem is entrapping O Lord! With Thee are lodged all complaints. 
You are present in all gatherings, and are the witness of all secrets, and the ultimate goal of all supplications, the expeller of all sorrows, the affluence of every needy person, the stronghold for every refugee, security for everyone who is terror-stricken, a shield for the weak a treasure for the indigent, the destroyer of griefs, the helper of the virtuous. 
Such is Allah, our Lord. There is no god but He. You satisfieth such of Thy slaves as trust unto Thee. You are the protector of him who is firmly attached to Thee and humiliates himself before Thee, a shield for him who seeks refuge with Thee, the help of him who looks up to Thee for help, the forgiver of sins for him who begs Thy pardon, 
the complier of the tyrant, the most grand of the grand, the most great of the great, the master of masters, the Lord of lords, the Succour of the grieved, the Helper of those crying for help, the Responder to the call of the distressed, the best of all listeners, the best of all observers, the best of all judges, the quickest of all reckoners, the most merciful of all the merciful the best of all forgivers, the satisfier of the needs of the faithful, and the hearer of the appeals of the virtuous. You are Allah, there is no god but Thee. 
You are the Cherisher and Sustainer of all the worlds You are the Creator and I am a creature. You are the Master and I am a servant, You are the Lord and I am a slave. You are the Provider while I am provided with sustenance, You are the Giver while I am a beggar, You are the Generous while I am a miser. You are the Mighty while I am weak, You are the Noble while I am humble. You are the independent while I am needy. You are the Master while I am slave. 
You are the Forgive of sins while I am sinful. You are the Omniscient while I am ignorant. You are the forbearing while I am hasty. You are the All-Merciful and I have been treated with mercy. You are the Provider of safety but I am involved in suffering. You are the Responder and I am the distressed. 
And I bear witness that verily You are Allah, there is no god but thee thou bestoweth favours upon Thy slaves even without their asking. And I bear witness that verily You are Allah, the One, the Peerless, the Unique, the independent, the Single, and verily to Thee we must return. 
May the blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and his family the holy and pure. 
O Lord, forgive my sins and keep my faults concealed and extend to me Thy special mercy and bounteous sustenance O the All-merciful! All praise is due to Allah the Cherisher and sustainer of all the worlds And for us Allah is the Sufficiency and the excellent Protector.

26,Dua Sabaasab,"This Dua’a is accredited to Imaam Saahibaz Zamaan (A.S.). It is recited to drive away the enemy, to dispel the spell of magic or sorcery, and to seek fulfillment of desires, material as well as spiritual. It is a tested and approved supplication. It is better to recite it after midnight, nevertheless it should be recited whenever occasion demands, or may be recited as many times as you like.","O Allah, send blessings on Muhammad and on the Progeny of Mohammad.
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
“So then Moosa became Nervous, a little anxious. We (Allah) said “worry not. You will positively have the Upper hand. (Staff): it will swallow up the Spellbinding artifice (ropes looking like Snakes) manipulated by a sorcerer who Shall not be successful, Whatever tricks he plays. Then the sorcerers put their foreheads on The ground and announced “We believe In the Lord of Moosa and Haroon” Thus They there were defeated and brought low. Thus the truth was established and that which they were doing was made vain Then We inspired Moosa Saying: “Strike The sea with your staff”. Then it put apart (the sea) into two high mountains of water. I have taken refuge with Allah, my Lord, And Lord of one and all magicians, The deceit of the treacherous, the trickery Of the swindlers, And from the harm of all the Poisonous animals, Vicious reptiles, Vicious reptiles, Vile disposition: And from the evil of all wickedness, From the violent fury of the oppressors, From the violent fry of the Oppressors, And the highhandedness of all Enemies, And the intrigue of the secret Plotters. I repulsed their offensive assault in the name of Allah. I took refuge with Allah from Their evil. I asked for Allah’s help against Them. I cut off the neck of their false Pretensions by the Divine Wisdom. I walled in inside the Divine Fortress to defend against their Soldiers. I pushed them back by the Predominant thrust of Allah, The distinct Sovereign, I hit and killed them by the Deadly arrow and sharp sword Of Allah, I caught hold of them, With the superior might of Allah, Dispersed them with the Permission of Allah, Threw them into chaos by the Divine decisive method, Pulled them to pieces with the Strength of Allah, Scattered them to the wind, Divided and forsaken, with the Power of Allah. There is no power and no Might except Allah’s the Greatest. I defeated the dishonest trick Ster with the powerful army Of Allah. I overcame the hostile enemy With the authority of Allah, The great. I destroyed him, who hatched Plots, with the infallible Strategy of the Almighty Allah. I broke the conspirator into Pieces with subtle policy of Allah, the Ever – Alert. I pushed back the transgressor In the name of the Glory of Allah, the impregnable. There is no power, no might, No dignity, no support, No victory, no help, No honour, except (with) Allah, the High, the Mighty. Allah’s blessings be on our Master and prophet Muhammad, and on his pure Descendents. I have conquered the troops (of enemies) with the power Of Allah; I put terror in their hearts, By the support of Allah. I created fear in the pit of their Stomachs, in the name of Allah’s honour. They have been thrown into Chaos by me with the authority Of Allah. They have been torn to pieces By me with the strength of Allah. They have been destroyed and Ruined by me with the omnipotence of Allah. I have taken away their power Of hearing and seeing; and destroyed The strength of their Limbs, and their confidence, With the superior unyielding Persevering and resolute power Of Allah. They have been driven away By me with the help of Divine Strategy of Allah, the High, The Great, and the All-powerful. They have been conquered, Worn down, disgraced, together With their soldiers, helpers, and Well- wishers by me with the Unfaltering aid, true and evident Help of Allah. They are now overwhelmed, Over-awed, Frightened, Frustrated Humiliated, Over-powered, Broken down Bound in chains, Out of breath, Tamed, Subdued. O Allah keep them away From us by Thy wisdom and Might, power and authority; Disunited, Mutilated, Out of breath, Tamed, Subdued, Distressed, Frightened, Humbled, Wandering, Forsaken, Overpowered Bewildered, Disappointed, Obscured, Gone astray while taking flight, Confused in their intentions, Perplexed in their hideouts, Tied up to their destruction, Engrossed in their physical Pleasures, With wounded bodies, Deteriorated minds, Their expectations cut off, Their arms and ammunition Unusable, Disillusioned in their intentions, Exposed to disgrace in their Escape, Thrown on the ground upon Their faces, Confused in their thoughts, Their hearts sealed off, Their hearts sealed off Their moratorium put aside, Their perception dimmed, Tied up to sluggishness, Addicted to sensuous pleasures And (restricted) to their limited Understanding, Their help exposed to calamities, And their soldiers pushed back. O Allah, keep safe from their Plan of action, Give help to ward off their Mischief, O Allah, apprehend them At once, be hard on Them and bring loss upon them As a punishment; Denied by everybody, thrown To the ground, Choked in breathing, Spell-bound in enjoyment, Thrown with the face on the Ground, suffocated Strangled in their own ropes and strings.
Bound in fetters, Kept tied up, Shackled in chains, Knocked down by disastrous Calamities, one after another Screaming in the agony of Trial, Cut off from roots, Abandoned to calamities and Loss, Deprived of their booty and Loot, Their supremacy vanquished O He who is always close by In misfortunes, Comes to help the needy when He makes a request. Allah has pre-ordained, “victory for Me and for My Messengers” Verily Allah is strong and Mighty.
Beware! Certainly only the Surely my protector is Allah, Who sent down the book, and Stands by the virtuous. “Verily, I ( Allah ) am sufficient For you against the sham Defiers, So I helped the faithful against Their enemies, and truth came To light.” There is no god save Allah, The one and only, who fulfilled His promise, and helped His servant and backed up His Group; And Himself destroyed the Hordes of the (infidels). So, His is the Kingdom, and (all) praise is for Him (Only). (all) praise is (only) for Allah, The Lord of the worlds. From the very beginning I Have taken refuge, in the safest Sanctuary of Allah, Under His shelter, never left Unguarded, Under the protection of Allah, Never rendered inaccessible, In the unconquerable and unfailing might of Allah, With His servants who are Never humbled, With His fighting force, never Subdued, In His unassailable quarters. In the name of Allah I began, And in the name of Allah I Came through, Became powerful, attacked and Won With the help of Allah’s might I overthrow my enemies. By the glory and greatness of Allah I defeat them, Subdue them with the wisdom And strength of Allah.
I grow strong, remain on guard And step forth against them in The name of Allah, And commit my affairs to Allah. Allah is sufficient for us, He Is the best Protector. “And you see them looking Towards you, but they do not See. Deaf, dumb and blind, And they will not return.” Command of Allah has come, Word of Allah has prevailed, The evident proof of Allah Has been made known to the Shameless enemies of Allah, The lackeys of Satan. They cannot prevail against you But may injure you a little; And if they fight they will run Away; Having no help thereafter, Inflicted with disgrace and Misery, Very sour when caught hold of, and always destroyed in Battles. They will not fight (in the Open battlefield) unless barricaded From all sides, and what Is out of sight is tightly Enclosed. They fight fiercely among Themselves; You think they are united, But their minds are confused, Because they are a people Without the power to reason” I have kept myself safe from Them inside fully fortified
Enclosure, Neither they can come in at Daytime nor break in at night. I receive strong support. I have entered the impregnable Sanctuary, And I cling and hold to the Steady rope. I protect myself with the Reliable strength of Allah, With the shield of Ameerul Momineen, peace be on him And take refuge with his Security, And put the seal-ring of Sulayman, son of Dawood Peace be on them, on my Finger. Wherever I go I find peace and Security, But my enemies are in disarray, Despised and ridiculed by one And all, Wrapped in disgrace and Inferiority, Bound in chains. I have set up protective Defence all around me, I am inside majestic palaces, Coronated with a dignified Crown, The mighty ever-sharp sword in My hand, Beyond the visual range of evil Eyes, Away from the dubious Surmises. My soul is at peace, Free from the danger of Enemies, Who have been tamed: and Afraid of me, are running away, As wild asses take to flight, Scared of a lion.
They are helpless to carry out Intrigues, which they planned against me. Their ears have turned deaf To hearing slanders about me, Their eyes have been deprived of sight, Their eyes have been deprived of sight, Their tongues are unable to Speak (ill) of me, Their minds are unfit to Identify me, their hearts take fright and Sink low before me.
Trembling they break off, Afraid of me, Abandoning their aim, Their pomp and show ending In a fiasco, Their determination is Crumbling, Their followers are deserting, Their affairs are in a mess, Discord in their opinions, their helpers are weakened, Their army is vanquished, As foretold those who return Back would be routed Altogether.
Certainly this is the promised Hour, the hour of disaster, I break into pieces their Haughtiness by the sublime ness of Allah In the manner of Ali (peace be on him), the matchless warrior, who turned upside down antagonism, and pointed out suppositions and surmises. I found favourable circumstances In the name of the Wonderful names and sublime verses of Allah. I beat my enemies black and Blue beyond repair, with Powerful blows, Their equipment is now in my Control, They are humbled, their ring-
Leaders are exterminated. Their guards and defenses lay In ruins, Their heads submissively hang In shame.
He who came after me has been waylaid, and he who Fought me has been liquidated. So I am victorious, happy, successful, triumphant. Verily I faithfully adhere to Pious expression, and hold Fast the safest handle (Islam): The strong rope is in my grip.
No more will the revolt of traitors, Deceit of imposters, or Ill-will of the greedy harm Me, till eternity. Never shall any one deceive Me. Never shall any one hurt me. Never shall any one take me For granted. “Say: I call upon my Lord: and I do not associate any one with Him. O Bestower of bounties! Give Me peace of mind, and protection against my enemies: and Appoint between me and them Exacting and active angels.
Help me with a large army and Obedient assistants, who could turn them away with penetrating superior means, drive them away with death-dealing blows, hit them with Sharp swords, shoot at them burning fireballs, burn them with consuming heat, reduce them to ashes with blazing flames. Under attack from all sides, in perpetual torment, except Him who is torn off by a wild beast (death) I attacked, challenged, came Upon, and overpowered Them, with the help of “Bismillaahir-Rah’ maanir- Raheem”, “T’aahaa”, “Yaa Seeen”, “D’ aariyaat”, “T’uwaseen” “Tanzeel”, “H’awaameem” revelaton and wisdom, “Kaaaf-Haa-Yaa-A’yyyn S’aaad” “H’aa-Meeem: A’yyyn-Seeen-Qaaaf” “Qaaf” of the Holy Quraan, “Noon”, “the pen and “what is written”, “stages of the stars”:, “T’oor”, “The written Book, spread in pages”,
“The House in heaven above the Kaa’-bah”, “The raised skies:” “The swelling sea”. Verily, the wrath of your Lord Will fall on, which no one Can put off. So they went backwards, Showing their heels; Isolated, sat in their homes, Sleepy and gloomy.
Truth won, And what they were doing had Been rendered useless. Overpowered, overthrown, Humbled. Spell of magic bro- Ken: there was total submission. So Allah protected him (Moosa) from the evil tricks, and put an end to their intentions, and to their comical ridicule, and brought down severe punishment upon the people of pharaoh: and the deceitful artifice was frustrated by the Divine wisdom. Allah is the ablest planner. Some people tried to scare a Group of ( faithful ) men by Telling them that an united Crowd was planning to hurt Them, but their faith grew more Strong, And they said “Allah is Sufficient for us. He is the Best Protector”.
From Allah favours and Bounties came in for them, And the evil touched them not, Because they obediently Aspired for Allah’s blessings. Allah is the Possessor of Abundant favours. O Allah, I seek Thy protection Against their evil designs, And Thou will nip in the bud Their opposition. I ask for the good, which is With Thee, O Allah.
“Verily soon you will find that Allah is sufficient for you. He is (the Best) Hearer, Knower.” Jibraa-eel is on my right hand, Meekaa-eel is on my left, Muhammad (blessings of Allah Be on him and his descendents Is in front, Ameerul Moomineen, peace be On him, is on my back, and Allah, the High, stays continually near over me. O He who put a barrier Between the two seas, Draw a curtain between me And my enemies, So that no harm may reach Me. Between me and my enemies Allah is the shield. Verily Allah’s shield is the Safest. Allah is sufficient to protect Me, There is no one who can Protect me except Him. “When you recite the Holy Quran, We ( Allah) draw an invisible Curtain between you and those Who do not believe in the Hereafter, And make their minds senile, And their ears deaf, When you recite (in Quran) That Allah is one they turn Sour in aversion.
Verily We have put on their Necks chains reaching unto the Chins, so that they are made Stiff-necked. And We have set a bar before Them and a bar behind them, And (thus) have covered them So that they see not.”
O Allah, draw Thy protective Curtains around me, that cannot be disheveled by Blowing winds, Nor can be pierced by spears. Through Thy Holy Spirit save My soul, for whoso comes Under its cover, is reverently Looked upto, And it creates awe and fear in the hearts of all the created Beings.
Allow me to recite Thy Beautiful names, And remember Thy high Similitues. Give me peace and goodness In that which I aspire for this Worldly life, and for the Hereafter.
Turn away the eyes of intense Starer, And substitute the hatred, Concealed in their hearts, with Goodwill, Which no one can do (except Thee). O Allah, Thou art my Sanctuary, Therefore, I take refuge with Thee. Thou art my support, Therefore, I seek Thy protection. O He before Whom the Arrogant necks bow down, and the heads of pharaohs Bent low in submission. Make me steady and careful Not be put to shame, Not to leave Thy protective Shield, Not to forget Thy remembrance, Not to be ungrateful to Thee. I remain under Thy protection, In darkness, or in daytime, At home, or in journey. Thy remembrance is my habit, Thy glorification is my routine.
O Allah, day in and day out My fear seeks Thy peaceful Sanctuary: So keep away Thy displeasure, And the hatred of Thy servants From me. Surround me with Thy Protective shield, And take me in under the Canvass of Thy favours. Deliver my soul through Thy Generosity. Set me free from the necessity Of going to wicked men for Help. I seek Thy support to avoid Corrupt companions, Ominous moments, Hostile enemies, Threatening calamities.
I take refuge with Thee from The ups and downs of day-to-day life, Except those events which follow the safe and true track, On account of Thy mercy, O the Most Merciful. Sent blessings on Mohammad and on his pure descendents.
Allah is sufficient for me, He is the Best Protector, The Best Master, The Best Supporter. In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. “By the brightness of the day, and the night when it is quietest: Your Lord has not forsaken You, nor He is angry with you. Verily that which is to come Will be better for you than That which is past. Soon your Lord will give unto You so that you will be content. Did He not find you an Orphan and take care?

29,Dua Alqama/Safwan,"In some books of supplication, this supplication is referred to as ""Dua Alqamah"" named after the companion of Imam Sadiq (a), Alqamah. However, Shaykh Abbas Qummi (qs) quotes very clear traditions in mafatih al-jinan that Imam Sadiq (a) recited this dua in the presence of the companion Safwan, not Alqamah. Therefore, the correct name of this supplication is ""Dua to be recited after Ziyarat-e-Ashura"" or ""Dua Safwan"". ","O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O He who gives answer to the cries of the persecuted! O He who pulls out the grief-stricken from agony and anguish! O He who comes to help those who shed tears in helplessness! O he who brings relief to those who cry for help! O He who is close by, nearer than my jugular vein! O He who makes peace between heart and mind; O He whom people search in the highest and noblest perspectives; in true and evident distinctions! O He who is Beneficent and Merciful in His authority! O He who knows what the furtive eyes betrays and what the secretive hearts conceal! O He whom do not deceive those who do everything in secret! O He whom intermingled voices of the countless callers (supplicants) do not stop from giving answer to each and every one! O He whom wants and needs of the infinite needy do not put in confusion for attending to one and all separately! O he whom clamorous determined pleading of petitioners do not upset! O He who reaches and takes hold of everything that tries to escape! O He who keeps together and brings into harmony people who know and understand! O He who examines the souls when they present themselves before Him after death! O he who, each day, has (new) distinct glory! O Fulfiller of wants and needs! O He who gives confront and respite in distress! O He who liberally satisfies those who solicit His favours! O He who stands by and follow close upon those who humble and fervently call on Him! O He who effectively support those who make sincere efforts! O He who is equal to and can do anything instead of another in the matters concerning all things; and nothing, in the heavens and the earth, can be out of the reach of or is free from His hold. I beseech Thee in the name of Muhammad, the last Prophet, and Ali, the commander of the faithfuls, in the name of Fatimah, the daughter of Thy Prophet, and in the name of Hasan and Husayn. I direct myself towards Thee, through them, in my address, through them I try to get a hearing, through them I put forward my case to get Thy favours, in their names I make a request to Thee; bound to Thee by oat, living a life according to Thy commands, I carry out my pledge by every means, in the name of the love and devotion Thou has for them, and the influence and status they enjoy in every dimension of Thy will, the superior most pre-eminence in wisdom and character Thou bestowed upon them to transcend above everything in the whole universe, in the name of Thy name Thou revealed to them in trust, on account of which Thou chose them in preference over everything found in the heavens and the earths, through which Thou built their syndrome, developed to perfection their surpassing excellence in knowledge, learning and deeds, out of all the rest of the people, till their completeness surpassed the total achievement of all the people put together; I request Thee to send blessings on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad; (and) look into the causes of my sorrows, anxieties, burdens, and do away with them, let me be equal to, sufficiently instructed, while dealing with my important enterprises and efforts, (and) carry out and fulfil my obligations, set me free from the clutches of poverty and from the pangs of hunger, let me have enough to live upon, free from the need to turn to others, let me be an adequate match for him who, I am afraid, shall create trouble, thwart the schemes of the one who, I am afraid, shall treat me harshly, let him, who, I am afraid, shall vex me, come to grief, expose and rebuke him, who, I am afraid, shall slander me, layout a plan to defeat him, who, I and afraid, shall try to deceive me by stratagem, take notice and act swiftly against him, who, I am afraid, shall treat me unjustly, take me into Thy custody to keep safe from the one who, I am afraid, shall tyrannize me, exercise Thy supreme authority to keep  him in check, who, I am afraid, shall rule over me, outwit him, who, I am afraid, shall lay traps to deceive me cunningly, make ready a fitting reply to him who, I am afraid, shall oppress me; keep off from me the obstinate deceit of the vindictive malicious, and the crafty artifice of the cunning imposter. O my Allah put an end to the intentions of him who desires to destroy me, outwit him who makes plans, keep off from me his deceit and intrigue, his hostility and fancy, keep me aloof, refusing to have anything to do with him, in whatever manner, on any occasion, as Thou wills. O my Allah divert his attention from me and involve him in his own over bearing anxieties which Thou will not cut down, in misfortune which Thou will not make easy to deal with, in waywardness from which Thou will not lead him back on the right path, in spiritless laziness which Thou will never change into fruitful activity, infamy and disgrace from which Thou will not allow him to rise to the surface, in broken fortune which Thou will not let get set. O my Allah let contemptible disgrace stick like a leech on the forehead between his two eyes, expose him to emptiness in every effort he makes, let wicked inclination, distraction and inactivity cut deep into his body and soul, in order that Thou diverts his attention from, me, absorbed in his own pursuits that do not free him to employ himself at another, make him think no more of me as he has willfully neglected and forgotten Thee, take away from me and throw overboard his attention, interest, communication, influence, support, and perverted thinking every evil he commits or draws it on himself, let everything he does go waste, defective and incomplete, and do not give any letup so that he is kept fully preoccupied and gets no time to pay attention to me or think of me. Give enough to me, O He who effectively and completely gives satisfaction. There is no one other than Thee who gives sufficiently, because Thou alone gives enough, no one else gives to the seeker’s satisfaction except Thee. Thou dispels the clouds of sorrows, no one else, save Thee can free the grief-stricken from cares. Thou comes to help, no one else, except Thee, can do a favour when called for help. Thou art near, ready to avert the danger, no one else, save Thee, is close enough to stand by in the hour of trouble. Comes to grief he who relies upon his own friends instead of Thee; or looks for his own supporters in place of Thee; frightened, cries for help having some one else other than Thee in mind; terrorized, runs away from the danger to a place of escape outside of Thy guaranty, and takes refuge in an asylum not watched over by Thee; and tries to bring himself to a place of safety through the help of created beings, excluding Thee, the Creator, Therefore, Thou art my trust, my hope, my retreat, my refuge, my security, unto which one can run for safety, for this reason I call for thy help, and seek Thy support to carry out my affairs easily and successfully, through Muhammad and the children of Muhammad I present myself before Thee, try to draw Thy attention and ask for salvation. So I beseech Thee, O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! Because (all) praise is for Thee (alone), and also prostration in thankfulness, thou alone listens to complaints, Thou alone is called upon for help. So I beseech Thee, O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! In the name of Muhammad and the children of Muhammad to send blessings on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad, to put to flight the sorrows, the anxieties, the burdens, now surrounding me from all sides, just as Thou made Thy Prophet free of his sorrows, anxieties and burden, and saved him from the terror of his enemies, in such manner as Thou made him to do so, let me also do the same, let me be free of care as Thou gave him joy, heart and confidence, let me have enough and be contended as Thou gave him sufficiently. Send away from me the terror that frightens me, the encumbrance that I find burdensome, the anxieties that wear me down, freeing me from their impact. Make me use my means freely to carry out and complete my business or employment, and do anything requisite instead of another, which may make me anxious about my affairs in this world or the hereafter. O Ameerul-Mu’mineen! O Abaa Abdullah! So far I am live and the days and nights follow each other I invoke Allah to send blessings on you forever and ever. May Allah not make my this pledge of physical and spiritual close association with you (both) the last fulfillment, and may Allah not separate me and you (both) from one another. O my Allah let me have a meaningful existence as Muhammad his descendants had lived, and die as they departed from this world, take to and carry out completely their creed; and raise me for the last judgment alongwith the people dedicated to them, and do not cut (us) in two (groups), even for the flash of an eyelid, ever, either in this world or in the life of the hereafter. O Ameerul Moomineen! O Abaa Abdullah! I come nearer to (you both) to establish close physical and spiritual relationship, and thereby seek nearness to Allah, my lord Nourishes and your lord Nourisher, through you I direct myself towards Him, and request you to speak in favour of my immediate at hand needs and wants I have put before Allah. So please speak well of me because, of course, with Allah your thoughtful judgement is highly credible, your disposition enjoys conclusive preference, your action keeps step with precise acumen, and a sure means of approach to gain His favour. I looked for and went through all possibilities and finally brought myself over to you in the hope of obtaining, speedily and successfully, fulfillment of my demands, their final settlement and favorable execution by Allah on account of your recommendations on my behalf to get Allah’s approval. So, let not my “seeing the light” be a bitter and “fallen short” change of heart, but make my “accepting the true faith” resolution a turning point leading to preference and full satisfaction in the matter of the disposal of my wants and needs; and direct me to bring myself over to that which Allah wills and commands. (because) there is no power and no might save Allah. I commit my case to Allah, anything neglected or taking place behind my back shall be taken care of Allah, I entrust Allah with the management of my affairs, and say: Allah is sufficient and enough, Allah pays attention to whoso makes a request to Him, there is nothing for me in that which is on the other side (in opposition) of Allah, and you, O my leaders, ultimately that which my lord Nourisher wills takes place, and happens not that which He wills not. There is no power and no might save in Allah. Unto you (both) I have come with love and affection, motivated under Divine incentive. May Allah not make my this pledge of physical and spiritual close association with you (both) the last fulfillment. I take advantage O my leader, O Ameerul Momineen, O my friend to whom I have surrendered, body and soul, and you O Abaa Abdullah, O my leader, and pay respects with love and affection, nonstop, (till) do not carry embracing days and nights, closely embracing it, to you, if Allah so wills, without ever being separated, in your names I beseech Him, that He wills it and does it because verily it is He who alone is praised, and he brings about beautiful things. I see the light and bring myself over to you, accepting the true faith, sorry for my earlier ignorance, thankful to Allah, always hopeful of getting His favour, never giving into despair, nor losing heart, ever ready to be near you, coming back again and again to see you, never “not longing” for your nearness, but, if Allah so wills, shall be always in your neighborhood as and everyday habit. There is no power and no might save in Allah. O my leaders I long for you and love to be in your company though the worldly people looked at it with indifference and kept aloof from your friendly intercourse. May not Allah let me fall short of in that which I hope for and in that which I look long and attentively to establish everlasting reunion with you. Verily He is near and gives positive answer to prayers. ",after Ziarat Ashura,دعائے علقمہ,دعای علقمه,دعاء القمة,दुआ अलकमा/सफ़वान,Dua Alqama/Safwan,DuaAlqama.mp3,,,

33,Dua 3rd Shaban,"Abu’l-Qasim ibn `Al’ al-Hamadaniy, the representative of Imam al-Hasan al-`Askary (a.s), received a document telling that our master, Grandson of the Holy Prophet (saws),Imam al-Husayn ibn `Ali (a.s), was born on the third of Sha`ban; therefore, you should observe fast on this day and recite the following supplication:","O Allah: I beseech You in the name of the one born on this day, the one promised with martyrdom before the beginning of his life and before his birth, the heavens and all their inhabitants wept for him; and so did the earth and those living one it; before his feet stepped on it; the mourned slain one; and the master of the Family (of Prophet hood); and the one who shall be backed with victory on the Day of Return; the one whom has been awarded with the favor of the Imams’ being from his offspring as compensation of his being slain; and the one awarded with the favor of the soil of his grave carrying cure; and the one awarded with the favor that he will be triumphing when he will be returned; and also the Prophet’s Successors from his offspring will be returned after the advent of their Rising Imam and after his occultation, so that they shall take revenge, and they shall retaliate, and they shall please the Omnipotent Lord, and they shall be the best supporters.
May Allah’s blessings be perpetually upon them whenever night and day succeed each other.
O Allah: I thus beg You in the name of them; and I implore You with the imploration of a sinful one who confesses of his guilt, and who has done evil to himself, due to his violations—the past and the present. He thus beseeches You for protection from You up to the place of his grave.
O Allah: (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and his Offspring, and include us with his group (on the Resurrection Day)and allow us to dwell in the House of Honor with him, and in the abode of residence.
O Allah: as You have conferred upon us with the honor of our recognition of him, (please) confer upon us with the honor of being near to him, and bestow upon us with the bliss of accompanying him and enjoying a close rank to him,and include us with those who submit to him totally, and those who pray (You) for sending blessings upon him whenever they mention him,and also upon all his Successors and Selected Ones, whom are defined by You as twelve persons,being the luminous stars,and the Arguments against all humankind.
O Allah: and (please) grant us on this day the best of grants,and make all our prayers on this day responded, in the same way as You gifted al-Husayn to Muhammad: his grandfather, and in the same way as the angels Futrus sought refuge with his (i.e. al-Husayn) cradle we are  thus seeking refuge with his tomb after him (i.e. his martyrdom) as we are witnessing the soil of him and expecting his return.

35,Dua Makarimul Akhlaq,"This Du'a has been taught by Imam Sajjad (as) and is a clear indication of the loftiness of moral virtues expected of a believer. Islam believes in the elevation of the human being, that a human is a great and dignified creation, far above the animal world. One of the signs of this dignity is the possession of noble and magnanimous qualities.
In order to achieve this behavioral excellence, man needs to overcome his base and selfish attributes, and cultivate noble qualities. In this Du""a the Imam specifies these qualities, and shows how we can try to inculcate them in ourselves. Taken as a lesson in Akhlaq, the Du'a is a wonderful program for those who wish to excel in good manners.
""The most complete in faith among the believers is he who has the best manners."" [Holy Prophet (s)]
""Habituate yourself to magnanimity, and choose for yourself the most excellent of all etiquettes, for virtuous behavior is a habit. Avoid the most low of all etiquettes, and struggle with yourself to avoid it, for evil is stubborn.""  [Imam Ali (a)]","O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, cause my faith to reach the most perfect faith, make my certainty the most excellent certainty, and take my intention to the best of intentions and my works to the best of works! 
O God, complete my intention through Thy gentleness, rectify my certainty through what is with Thee, and set right what is corrupt in me through Thy power! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, spare me the concerns which distract me, employ me in that about which Thou wilt ask me tomorrow, and let me pass my days in that for which Thou hast created me! Free me from need, expand Thy provision toward me, and tempt me not with ingratitude! Exalt me and afflict me not with pride! Make me worship Thee and corrupt not my worship with self-admiration! Let good flow out from my hands upon the people and efface it not by my making them feel obliged!98 Give me the highest moral traits and preserve me from vainglory! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, raise me not a single degree before the people without lowering me its like in myself and bring about no outward exaltation for me without an inward abasement in myself to the same measure! 
O God, bless Muhammad and Muhammad’s Household, give me to enjoy a sound guidance which I seek not to replace, a path of truth from which I swerve not, and an intention of right conduct in which I have no doubts! Let me live as long as my life is a free gift in obeying Thee, but if my life should become a pasture for Satan, seize me to Thyself before Thy hatred overtakes me or Thy wrath against be becomes firm! 
O God, deposit in me no quality for which I will be faulted, unless Thou settest it right, no flaw for which I will be blamed, unless Thou makest it beautiful, no deficient noble trait, unless Thou completest it! 
O God, bless Muhammad and Muhammad’s Household and replace for me the animosity of the people of hatred with love, the envy of the people of insolence with affection, the suspicion of the people of righteousness with trust, the enmity of those close with friendship, the disrespect of womb relatives with devotion, the abandonment of relatives with help, the attachment of flatterers with love set right, the rejection of fellows with generous friendliness, and the bitterness of the fear of wrongdoers with the sweetness of security! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, appoint for me a hand against him who wrongs me, a tongue against him who disputes with me, and a victory over him who stubbornly resists me! Give me guile against him who schemes against me, power over him who oppresses me, refutation of him who reviles me, and safety from him who threatens me! Grant me success to obey him who points me straight and follow him who guides me right! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and point me straight to resist him who is dishonest toward me with good counsel, repay him who separates from me with gentle devotion, reward him who deprives me with free giving, recompense him who cuts me off with joining, oppose him who slanders me with excellent mention, give thanks for good, and shut my eyes to evil! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, adorn me with the adornment of the righteous, and clothe me in the ornaments of the godfearing, through spreading justice, restraining rage, quenching the flame of hate, bringing together the people of separation, correcting discord, spreading about good behaviour, covering faults, mildness of temper, lowering the wing,99 beauty of conduct, gravity of bearing, agreeableness in comportment, precedence in reaching excellence, preferring bounteousness, refraining from condemnation, bestowing bounty on the undeserving, speaking the truth, though it be painful, making little of the good in my words and deeds, though it be much, and making much of the evil in my words and deeds, though it be little! Perfect this for me through lasting obedience, holding fast to the community, and rejecting the people of innovation and those who act in accordance with original opinions! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, appoint for me Thy widest provision in my old age and Thy strongest strength when I am exhausted, try me not with laziness in worship of Thee, blindness toward Thy path, undertaking what opposes love for Thee, joining with him who has separated himself from Thee, and separating from him who has joined himself to Thee! 
O God, make me leap to Thee in times of distress, ask from Thee in needs, and plead to Thee in misery! Tempt me not to seek help from other than Thee when I am distressed, to humble myself in asking from someone else when I am poor, or to plead with someone less than Thee when I fear, for then I would deserve Thy abandonment, Thy withholding, and Thy turning away, O Most Merciful of the merciful! 
O God, make the wishing, the doubt, and the envy which Satan throws into my heart a remembrance of Thy mightiness, a reflection upon Thy power, and a devising against Thy enemy! Make everything he causes to pass over my tongue, - the indecent or ugly words, the maligning of good repute, the false witness, the speaking ill of an absent man of faith or the reviling of one present, and all things similar - a speech in praise of Thee, a pursual of eulogizing Thee, an excursion in magnifying Thee, a thanksgiving for Thy favour, an acknowledgement of Thy beneficence, and an enumeration of Thy kindnesses! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, let me not be wronged while Thou canst repel from me, let me not do wrong while Thou art powerful over holding me back, let me not be misguided while Thou art able to guide me, let me not be poor while with Thee is my plenty, let me not be insolent while from Thee comes my wealth! 
O God, I come to Thy forgiveness, I go straight to Thy pardon, I yearn for Thy forbearance, and I trust in Thy bounty, but there is nothing with me to make me warrant Thy forgiveness, nothing in my works to make me merit Thy pardon, and nothing on my behalf after I judge my soul but Thy bounty, so bless Muhammad and his Household and bestow Thy bounty upon me! 
O God, make my speech be guidance, inspire me with reverential fear, give me success in that which is most pure, and employ me in what is most pleasing to Thee! O God, let me tread the most exemplary path and make me live and die in Thy creed! O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, give me to enjoy moderation, make me into one of the people of right behaviour, the proofs of right conduct, and the servants of righteousness, and provide me with triumph at the place of Return100 and safety from the Ambush!101 
O God, take to Thyself from my soul what will purify it and leave for my soul that of my soul that will set it right, for my soul will perish unless Thou preservest it! 
O God, Thou art my stores when I sorrow, Thou art my recourse when I am deprived, from Thee I seek aid when troubled and with Thee is a substitute for everything gone by, a correction for everything corrupted, and a change from everything Thou disapprovest. So show kindness to me with well-being before affliction, wealth before asking, right conduct before misguidance; suffice me against the burden of shame toward the servants, give me security on the Day of Return, and grant me excellent right guidance! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, repel from me through Thy gentleness, feed me through Thy favour, set me right through Thy generosity, heal me through Thy benefaction, shade me in Thy shelter, wrap me in Thy good pleasure, and give me success to reach the most guided of affairs when affairs confuse me, the purest of works when works seem similar, and the most pleasing to Thee of creeds when creeds conflict! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, crown me with sufficiency, place in me excellent guardianship,102 give me to guide correctly, tempt me not with plenty, grant me excellent ease, make not my life toil and trouble, and refuse not my supplication in rejection, for I make none rival to Thee and I supplicate none with Thee as equal! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, hold me back from prodigality, fortify my provision against ruin, increase my possessions through blessing them, and set me upon the path of guidance through piety in what I spend! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, spare me the burden of earning, and provide for me without reckoning, lest I be distracted from Thy worship through seeking and carry the load of earning’s ill results! 
O God, bestow upon me what I seek through Thy power and grant me sanctuary from what I fear through Thy might! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, save my face through ease, and demean not my dignity through neediness, lest I seek provision from those whom Thou hast provided and asks for bestowal from the worst of Thy creatures! Then I would be tried by praising him who gave to me and afflicted with blaming him who held back from me, while Thou - not they - art patron of giving and holding back. 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household and provide me with soundness in worship, detachment in renunciation, knowledge put into action, and abstinence in measure! 
O God, seal my term with Thy pardon, verify my expectation in hoping for Thy mercy, smooth my paths to reach Thy good pleasure, and make my works good in all my states! 
O God, bless Muhammad and his Household, incite me to remember Thee in times of heedlessness, employ me in Thy obedience in days of disregard, open a smooth road for me to Thy love, and complete for me thereby the good of this world and the next! 
O God, and bless Muhammad and his Household the best Thou hast blessed any of Thy creatures before him and wilt bless any of them after him, and give to us in this World good, and in the next world good, and protect me through Thy mercy from the chastisement of the Fire!",,دعاء مکارم الاخلاق,دعای مکارم الاخلاق,دعاء مكارم الاخلاق,दुआ मकारिमुल अख्लाक,Dua Makarimul Akhlaq,makarimulakhlaq.mp3,,,

O my Allah, let me answer the purpose of  (my) religion, because nothing else but this alone guarantee success in my works; make my eternal life (here- after) blissful, because at all events it will be my permanent abode, a sanctuary-away from the vile and the  worthless (mean world); let me live a life that fully absorbs good and beauty, every where, at all times, let me die a death that sets me free (happy and blessed) from every kind of evil. O my Allah send blessing on Muhammad, the Last Prophet, the culmination of all Messengers, on his pure and pious children, on his noble companions, and grant me in the hours of this Tuesday three favours. Do not take up the account of my sins, but to overlook them, donot put me in difficulties, but to overcome them, donot be hard and severe, except to curb the transgression, in the name of ""Bismillah"" the Best of names. In the name of Allah, the Lord of the earth, and the heavens, I keep off and drive away  everything which is ugly and bad, worst of all is His displeasure. I collect and gather everything which is beautiful and good, best of all is His pleasure; so be kind and merciful when my time comes, O He Who owns and distributes favours freely! 
O Allah! Send blessing on Muhammad and on the children of Muhammad.",by Imam Zainul Abideen (as)  ,منگل کے دن کی دعا,دعای روز سه شنبه,دُعاءُ يَوْمِ الثّلاثاء,मंगलवार की दुआ,Tuesday Dua,tuesdaydua.mp3,,,

45,Dua for Aamal Umme Dawood,"Who was Umm Dāwūd?
She was Fātima, the mother of Dāwūd, a great grandson of the 2nd Imam, Hasan al- Mujtaba (a) and a foster brother of the 6th Imam, Ja‘far al-Sādiq (a). Umm Dāwūd had served as a wet nurse to Imam as-Sādiq (a).
Once, the 6th Imam (a) was ill so Fātima (Umm Dāwūd) went to visit him. During her visit the Imam inquired about his [foster] brother Dāwūd. Fātima replied that she had lost hope in finding him, for she did not even know whether he was alive or dead. The Imam taught her an A‘māl (a combination of Qur’anic recitations, supplications and prayers) that was very effective in getting a quick outcome of one’s legal needs. It is said that, whoever performs this A‘māl, the doors of skies are opened for him/her, and the angels descend from heavens to receive him and to inform him of the good news of acceptance.
Umm Dāwūd said that she waited till she performed the A‘māl on 15th of Rajab. The next day someone knocked the door and, to her amazement it was her son Dāwūd, who got released from the prison. Dāwūd narrated to her mother that he was held in a very high security prison with chains on his neck, hands and feet. Suddenly, one fine day the guards came in and took him to Mansūr, the ruler. He ordered the chains to be removed, gave Dāwūd ten thousand Dirhams, and a fast ride to take to him home.  
It is reported authentically that Umme Dawood asked wether this Amal can be performed in anyother month than Rajab. The Holy Imam replied in the affirmative and said that it can be performed on Day of Arfa and if perchance Arfa falls on Fri day, the performer will not have finished yet that he will be absolved of his sins.
This Amal can be performed in any month. One should observe fast on 13th, 14th and 15th day of the month and recite this Do'a on 15th as described above. His wish inshaallah will be fulfilled","Allah the Most High, the Great has spoken the truth, there is no god but He, the Ever Living, the Self-Subsisting, Grand, Glorious, the Beneficent, the Merciful the Forbearing, the Generous. There is none like Him. He is all-Hearing, All Seeing, AII-Knowing, All-aware.
Allah stands witness that there is no god but He and (so do) the angels and those possessed of knowledge. He stands firm an justice. There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise. And His honored Messengers preached and stand as one of the witnesses for this.
Allah all praise is for you, all esteem is for you, only You prevail upon every thing. Bounty is from you. All Greatness and all Dominance is for You, For You is all beauty, only You oblige and for You is all glorification. Holiness and recitation of Tahleel (La Ilaha 1llallah) is only for you. All praise of greatness is for you. For you is what is seen and for you is what is not seen. For you is what is above the High Heavens and for You is what is underneath the Abyss. The lowly earths are for you and for you is the Hereafter and the world. And for you is what you are pleased with by the praise (of others) and thanks giving and bounties.

46,Dua for Shabe Meraaj,"In his book of ‘al-Balad al-Am¢n,’ al-Kaf`amiy has instructed the following: Recite the following supplication on the Divine Mission Night:","O Allah: I beseech You in the name of the Grandest Manifestation at this night in this glorified month and in the name of the honored Messenger, that You send blessings upon Mu¦ammad and his Household and that You forgive us that which You know better than we do. O He Who knows while we do not. O Allah: (please do) bless us at this night which You have exalted with the honor of the Divine Mission, and You have esteemed with Your honoring, and You have raised to the Honorable Place. O Allah: We thus beseech You in the name of the honorable mission, the gentle master,   and the chaste line   that You may bless Mu¦ammad and his Household   and that You decide our deeds at this night,   as well as all the other nights, as acceptable,   our sins as forgiven,   our good efforts as praiseworthy,   our evildoings as concealed,   our hearts as pleased with decent wording,   and our sustenance that You decide for us as copiously flowing with easiness.   O Allah: Verily You see [everything] but nothing can see You   while You are in the Highest Prospect.   And, verily, to You are the [final] return and goal.   And, verily, to You are causing to death and granting of life.   And to You are the Last and the First [of all things].   O Allah: we, surely, seek Your protection against meeting of disgrace and shame   and against committing that which You have ordered us not to do.   O Allah: we, surely, pray You for Paradise, out of Your mercy,   and we seek Your protection against Hellfire.   So, (please do) save us from it, in the name of Your omnipotence.   We, also, pray You for the women of Paradise;   so, please do grant us them, in the name of Your might.   And (please do) make the most expansive of our sustenance be given to us when we become old aged,   and make the best of our deeds be at the time close to our death.   And (please do) extend [our ages and make us spend them] in acts of obedience to You,   and in all that which draws us near to You,   and in all that which allow us to enjoy a good position with You,   and in all that which make our lives acceptable by You.   And (please do) improve our recognition of You under all circumstance and conditions.   And do not refer us to any of Your beings lest they shall always remind us of their favors to us.   And please favor us by settling all our needs, in this world as well as the Next World.   And (please do) do the same thing to our forefathers, our descendants,   and all our brethren-in-faith;   with regard to all that which we have besought You for ourselves   O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy.   O Allah: we, verily, beseech You by Your Grand Name   and Your Eternal Kingdom   to send blessings upon Mu¦ammad and the Household of Mu¦ammad   and to forgive our grave sins,   for none can forgive the grave save the All-great.   O Allah: this is Rajab, the honored month,   which You have honored us through it, being the first of the Sacred Months,   and You have selected us for this honor from amongst the other nations.   So, all praise be to You; O the Lord of Magnanimity and Generosity.   I thus beseech You by Your Name,   the grandest, the grandest, the grandest,   the most majestic, the most honorable,   that You have created so that it has settled under Your Shadow   and it thus shall never transfer to anyone other than You—   I beseech You to send blessings upon Mu¦ammad and his Household, the immaculate,   and to include us, during this month, with those who practice acts of obedience to You   and those who hope for Your admission.   O Allah: (please do) lead us to the Right Path,   and choose for us the best resting-place with You,   under a dense shade   and abundant possession.   Surely, You are Sufficient for us! Most Excellent are You, and in You do we trust!   O Allah: (please do) make us return (to You) with success and victory;   neither accursed (by You) nor misleading (the Right Path),   out of Your mercy; O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy.   O Allah: I earnestly beseech You, in the name of the matters that bring about Your forgiveness   and the matters that incumbently achieve Your mercy,   to grant me safety from all sins,   gain of all decencies,   attainment of Paradise,   redemption against Hellfire.   O Allah: In the same way as suppliants have besought You, I am beseeching You.   And in the same way as implorers have begged You, I am begging You.   And in the same way as requesters have asked You, I am asking You.   O Allah: You are (my) trust and hope;   and You are the ultimate desire in my supplications.   O Allah: send blessings upon Mu¦ammad and his Household   and establish conviction in my hear,   light in my sight,   well-wishing in my chest,   and the mention of You on my tongue day and night,   and expansive sustenance that is neither failing nor banned. So, please provide me sustenance   and bless that which You decide for me,   and make me self-sufficient,   and make me desire for none save You;   out of Your mercy, O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy. *You may then prostrate yourself and repeat the following invocation one hundred times:* All praise be to Allah Who has guided us to the recognition of Him, has included us exclusively with the protection of Him, and has granted us the obedience to Him. Thanks, thanks. *When you raise your head (i.e. finish the prostration), you may recite the following:* O Allah: I am turning my face toward You asking for the settlement of my needs. And I depend upon You in submitting my problem. And I submit before You my Imams and Masters. O Allah: benefit us by our love for them, and make us follow their examples, and grant us their companionship, and allow us to enter Paradise with their group; by Your mercy, O the most Merciful of all those who show mercy.

47,Dua Saifi (Qamoos),"Shaykh M¢rz¡ al-N£r¢—may Allah honor his tomb—has mentioned this supplicatory prayer in his book entitled al-¯a¦¢fah al-`Alawiyyah II, adding, “This supplication has been explained by the master scholars of talismans and spiritual sciences with strange words referring to marvelous effects ensuing from reciting it.” Yet, I will not refer to these details because I cannot depend upon their accuracy. Rather, I, imitating our master scholars and avoiding falling in faults, only mention the original text of the supplication, which is as follows:","In the Name of Allah; the All-beneficent, the All-merciful O my Lord, include me with the profundity of the ocean of Your Oneness and in the enormity of the sea of Your singleness. Strengthen me with the strength of the influence of the authority of Your Uniqueness so that when I come out to the space of the breadth of Your mercy, my face will have the twinkles of the shining of the nearness to the traces of Your protection, being venerable out of Your venerability, mighty out of Your care (for me), esteemed, and honored out of Your instruction and purity. Dress me with the garments of dignity and tolerability, make easy for me to attain the courses of communication and attainment (to You), adorn me with the crown of decorum and solemnity, and put affection between your beloved ones and me in this worldly abode as well as the Abode of Enduring Settlement. Out of the illumination of Your Name, confer upon me with honor and authority due to which all hearts and souls will submit to me, and all selves and ghosts will succumb to me. O He to Whom all the tyrants surrender, and before Whom all the kings submit! There in neither shelter nor refuge (to protect) against You save to You, there is no help save through You, and there is no reliance save upon You. Repel against me the trickeries of the envious ones and the murk of the evils of the stubborn ones. Have mercy upon me under the pavilion of Your Throne; O most Generous of all those who show generosity! Aid my appearance to attain Your pleasure and illuminate my heart and inner self by making me acquainted with the courses to acting for Your sake. O my God, how does it come that I leave Your Door with disappointment after I had come to it with full faith in You? How is it possible that You drive me to despair of Your endowment after You have instructed me to pray to You? Here I am coming to You seeking shelter with You. Keep me far away from my enemies just as You have kept my enemies far away from one another. Take their sights away from me through the Light of Your Holiness and the Grandeur of Your Glory. You are verily Allah Who confers with the splendid honoring graces upon those who secretly pray to You out of Your tremendous mercy. O Ever-living, O Self-subsisting, O Lord of Glory and Honor! May Allah send blessings to our master and Prophet, Mu¦ammad, and upon all of his Household—the purified and immaculate.

49,Dua Jaushan E Sagheer,"This du'a is narrated on the authority of the seventh Imam Musa al-Kazim, peace he upon him, and it is said that it is a very effective supplication, having all the merits of al Jawshan al Kabir. ""Sayyid ibn Tawus in his book Muhaj al dawat have narrated that Imam Kazim (a.s.) used to recite this dua when he knew that the Abbaside caliph was planning to kill him""","My God, many an enemy drew up the sword of hostility against me, honed the dagger's edge, sharpened the arrows' points, made ready deadly poisons, leveled his bow at me, and, keeping an eye on me, harbored evil thoughts to force me to swallow, against my will, the deadly bitter poison. 
Thou came to know that I am too weak to bear hardships and too exhausted to withstand misfortunes, and took notice of my shortcoming that I cannot confront the enemy who had planned to attack me, and perceived my isolation amid the multitude of gathering enemies, sitting in ditches, ready to pounce upon me, while I gave no thought to sitting in ambush and retaliating. So with Thy might, Thou came to stand by me, and Thy help made me strong and disappointed him in spite of the larger number [of his forces], by rendering his weapons unserviceable. And Thou gave me the upper hand over him by catching him in the very trap he laid for me, and threw him into the abyss he dug for me, and gave no hand to his grudging deed, and did not allow him to assuage the fury of his anger. Biting his thumb, he turned back on his heels, and his comrades, ashamed, dispersed in haste. 
So praise be to Thee, O Lord, in [Thy] invulnerable Omnipotence, and prudent Forbearance. Bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and let me be among those who thank Thee for Thy bounties and remember Thee for Thy favours. 
[2] My God, many a disobedient tyrant has tried treacherously to oppress me, has laid traps to catch me, was continuously spying on me, and, like a beast of prey who lies in wait for his prey, has tried to surprise me, whereas in public he received me with open arms and a welcoming smile on his face, as if innocent. 
So when Thou took notice of his clandestine trickery and foul play and the fact that in spite of professing the same faith he was devising schemes to injure me, then Thou contemptuously caught hold of him and threw him down headlong, completely destroying him; after which he found himself in the ditch he had dug for me, smeared with the dust below his feet poverty and disease overtook him. Thus Thou rewarded him in kind by making the stones and arrows he hurled at me rebound upon him, and by putting his own rope around his neck. Shame and disappointment came upon him, he suffered disgrace and dishonour, his pride and arrogance gave way to humility, his power turned into helplessness, and finally, at the last moment, when he was sure to overwhelm me, he fell into his own trap and was caught and bound with the rope made for me in the days of his authority. 
In fact it was me who would have suffered likewise if Thou, O my Lord, had not come to my rescue with Thy mercy. 
So praise be to Thee, O Lord, in [Thy] invulnerable Omnipotence, and prudent Forbearance. Bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and let me be among those who thank Thee for Thy bounties and remember Thee for Thy favours. 
[3] My God, many an envier, sick in his throat with grudges and choked up with anger, has cast a slur on me in an attempt to hurt me with his loose talk and to brand me unfairly with his own defects, slyly frowned upon me, exposed my integrity to his insinuating remarks, and wrongly put the burden of his sins on my shoulders. Therefore, I called upon Thee, O my Lord, expecting to receive Thy help, believing in Thy prompt response, confident of Thy immediate action to disperse the affliction, a fact of which I have always been aware, and knowing full well that whoever comes under Thy merciful protection is never betrayed, and whoever turns to Thee for help is never turned out. So Thou preserved me in safety from the harm of his threats, and through Thy All-Prevailing Power put an end to his evil schemes. 
So praise be to Thee, O Lord, in [Thy] invulnerable Omnipotence, and prudent Forbearance. Bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and let me be among those who thank Thee for Thy bounties and remember Thee for Thy favours. 
[4] My God, many a dark cloud bearing sorrow and misery has been dispersed by Thee; Thy blessings have dropped from the heavens like gentle rain, and Thy favours have flowed like abounding rivers; Thou hast dried up the source of misfortune, bestowed extra benefits, made available reliable protection, kept away violent calamities, and set forth events [in my favour], in strict compliance with Thy commands, never going wayward, and moving on the appointed course, never overstepping. 
So praise be to Thee, O Lord, in [Thy] invulnerable Omnipotence, and prudent Forbearance. Bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and let me be among those who thank Thee for Thy bounties and remember Thee for Thy favours. 
My God, many a hopeful expectation I cherished which Thou realized; and Thou blocked the inroad of poverty into my life, neutralized the severity of mortal calamities, and removed many a hardship. 
Thou art not accountable for what Thou does, whereas others are. Thou give out everything but never run short of anything. Thou bestow whenever beseeched, and many a time takes the initiative. Thy benefaction never falls short of expectations. It is not for Thee, O Lord, to be less than rewarding, obliging, benevolent, and beneficent. 
Although Thou went on bestowing benefits, favours, and bounties, I failed to observe Thy prohibitions, took liberties, and, unmindful of Thy warnings, gave in to my adversary and did not oppose Thy enemy. 
My God and my helper, I was guilty of not being thankful for Thy beneficence, because of which I could not prevent myself making mistakes. 
My God, here stands Thy humble servant, who knows and testifies that Thou art one, and makes admission of falling short of discharging his duty towards Thee, and gives evidence of Thy countless blessings and excellent kindness and abundant good. So, my God, my Master, mercifully give me what I want through Thy mercy, so that I may aspire for Thy mercy, and through it reach the height where Thy approval is available and where there is freedom from Thy displeasure, in the name of Thy Might and overswaying Power, and for the sake of Thy Prophet, Muhammad, may the blessings of Allah be upon him and upon his family. 
So praise be to Thee, O Lord, in [Thy] invulnerable Omnipotence, and prudent Forbearance. Bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and let me be among those who thank Thee for Thy bounties and remember Thee for Thy favours.

The withered mortal forehead prostrates before the Everlasting, the Everliving.

51,Dua Iftitah,"Du' al-Iftitah was taught by the Twelfth Imam Imam Mehdi (as)  to recite every night during the month Ramadhan. The Du'a is excellent for moulding man's attitude towards his Creator, as it discusses many aspects of the wretchedness of the human being, and the grace of Allah. The Dua can be divided into two parts: 1) Man's relationship with Allah & 2) Divine leaders","O Allah, I begin the glorification with praise of Thee; Thou, from Thy bounties, gives out freely the truth and salvation; I know for certain that Thou art the most merciful in disposition of forgiveness and mercy, [but] very exacting at the time of giving exemplary punishment and chastisement to wrongdoers, the Omnipotent in the domain of absolute power and might.
O Allah, Thou has given me permission to invoke Thee and beseech Thee, so listen, O Hearer, to my words of praise, and give a favourable reply to my supplication, and minimize my falling into misery, O the often-forgiving.
O my Allah, many a trouble Thou hath removed; many a sorrow hath Thou dispelled; many a misery hath Thou mitigated; and at all times Thou spreadeth out mercy, and cutteth short the tightening circles of misfortunes.
All praise be to Allah, Who has not taken unto Himself a wife, nor a son, and Who has no partner in sovereignty, nor any protecting friend through dependence. Magnify Him with all magnificence.
All praise be to Allah, with full gratitude for all his bounties.
All praise be to Allah, Who has no opposition to His rule, nor any challenge to His commands.
All praise be to Allah, Who has no counsel to meddle with His operation of creation, nor is there anything similar to Him in His greatness.
All praise be to Allah, Whose commandments operate in Creation; His glory is evident through love and kindness.
His distinct overflowing generosity is freely available through His unlimited bestowals which do not exhaust His resources, and He does not swell the numerous benefits except because of generosity and kindness. Verily He is mighty, generous.
O Allah, I ask for some from much, in the midst of my very many needs for which I entirely depend on Thee, and, since eternity, Thou art able to do without it but for me it is a titanic effort and for Thee is very easy and simple.
O Allah, truly, when Thou pardon my sins, overlook my mistakes, take a lenient view of my disorderly conduct, cover up my foul actions, show consideration in spite of my many transgressions committed willfully or negligently, I am tempted to ask for that which I do not deserve, from Thee Who, through Thy mercy, gives me the daily bread provides me with that which is suitable for me, through Thy control; and distinguishes me with a favourable reply to my requests.
So I persist in calling out, believing in Thee, and I invoke Thee, talking familiarly, not afraid, nor shy, but assured of Thy love and kindness whenever I turn to Thee A temporary setback, and I, out of ignorance, begin to despair, although perhaps slowing down may be a blessing in disguise. because Thou alone knows [all] the consequences. I know no generous master who is more accommodating to dissatisfied servants that Thou art to me.
O Lord, Thou giveth an invitation but I turn it down. Thou becometh familiar with me but I do not care for Thee. Thou loveth me but I do not correspond to Thee as if Thou are overreaching me. Yet Thou doth not abstain from bestowing favours and blessings on me from Thy mercy and generosity so have mercy on Thy ignorant servant Verily Thou art generous and kind.
Praise be To Allah the owner of sovereignty, Who sets the course of the skies and the stars controls the winds, causes the daybreak, and administers authority, the Lord of the worlds.
Praise be to Allah for His indulgence in the wake of His all-awareness.
Praise be to Allah for His amnesty ensuing from His omnipotence.
Praise be To Allah for the respite He allows In spite of provocation. He is able to do what He wills.
Praise be to Allah, the creator of all the created beings, Who makes sustenance freely available, starts the day, the owner of glory, might, favours, and bounties, Who is far away, invisible, and nearest, so near that He is fully aware of the whispered secrets, the Blessed, the Praised.
Praise be to Allah, Who has no equal to challenge Him, nor is there an image comparable to Him, nor a helper to assist Him. He tames the powerful by His force, and disgraced are the terrible before His greatness; so He, through His power, fulfils that which He wills.
Praise be to Allah, Who gives answer to me whenever I call Him; covers up my shortcomings yet I disobey Him; gives me the largest part of the bounties yet I want more. Many favours He has sanctioned; many terrible dangers He has averted; and many blossoming joys he has made available for me. Therefore, I sing His praises and recite His glorifications.
Praise be to Allah. None can disclose anything hidden by Him; none can shut the doors kept open by Him; no one who makes a request is sent away disappointed by Him; and no one who looks long and attentively is deluded in his hopes.
Praise be to Allah, Who gives protection to the frightened; comes to the help of the upright; promotes the cause of the weak and the enslaved; annihilates the autocrats; destroys rulers and appoints the 'awaited savours' in their place.
Praise be to Allah, Who breaks everything belonging to the oppressors; puts an end to the tyrants; watches over the fugitives; brings assistance to those who cry out for help; meets and clears up the demands of the needy beseechers; supports the faithful.
Praise be to Allah. In his awe-inspiring fear the heavens and its dwellers tremble and shiver; the earth and its inhabitants shake and quiver; the oceans and all that floats and swims in its waters flow together in excitement and tumult.
Praise be to Allah, Who has guided us to this. We could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us.

52,Dua Baite Mamoor,"Here the Holy Prophet (SAW) said to Gabriel: What is the virtue of these words?  Gabriel said: Far away! Far away! It is something impossible, for if the angels of seven heavens and seven earths gather to describe its virtues till the Day of Judgment, they are not able to describe a single part of it.” “Therefore when a man says: O You who reveal the beauty and conceal the ugly, God covers up his defects and has mercy on him and makes him look beautiful on the Day of Judgment and covers his defects with a thousand veils in the world and the hereafter.”   “And when he says: O You who do not take the wrongdoer to task and do not tear the veil, God will not take him to task on the Day of Judgment and on the day all veils are torn, God will not tear his veil.”   “And when he says: O You who are Great Forgiver, God will forgive his sins even if they are as much as the sea foam.”   “And when he says: O You are of great forbearance, God will forgive him such sins as theft, drinking wine, and other sins.”   “And when he says: O You who have pardon abounding, God will open seventy gates of Mercy to him in a way that he will be overwhelmed by God’s Mercy till he dies.”   “And when he says: O You who have opened Your hands for mercy, God opens His hands of Mercy to him.”   “And when he says: O Hearer of all whisperings, O You to whom all complaints are made, God will give him rewards as many as given to every afflicted and unaffiliated, every losing and sick as well as destitute and every one affected by calamity till the Day of Judgment.”   “And when he says:  O Possessor of great favor, God will make him noble as prophets.”   “And when he says: O You who give blessings to Your servants when they do not deserve it, God will grant him rewards as many as the number of those who have thanked His blessings.”   “And when he says: O our Master, O our Lord, God will say: My angels! Be witness that I forgave him and I will give him rewards as many as those being in paradise and Hell, the seven heavens and the earths, the sun, the moon, the stars, drops of rain, sands mountains, dews and throne.”   “And when he says: O our Guardian, God will make his heart replete with faith.”   “And when he says: O the Goal of our desires, God will give him the love of all creatures on the Day of Judgment.”   “And when he says: I beseech You O God not to make my being ugly with Fire, God will say: My servant has asked Me to free him from Fire.  O My angels! Be witness that I set him, his parents, his brothers, his household, his children and his neighbors free from the Fire and accepted his intercession for a thousand others who deserved the punishment by fire and saved them from it.”  “O Muhammad! Teach this Dua only to men of piety.  Do not even teach it to hypocrites, for it is a Dua which God will answer.  This is the Dua recited by the men of Beite Ma’moor (an edifice in the fourth or seventh heaven as sacred as Ka’aba) when they circumambulate it.” “While being happy and having a smile on his lips, Gabriel come down from heaven to the Holy Prophet (SAW) bringing the following Dua saying: God has sent a gift for you.  The Holy Prophet said: What is the gift O Gabriel! Gabriel said: Words along with treasures of heaven by which God has honoured you.  The Holy Prophet said: What are those words O Gabriel?! Gabriel said: Say: ","O You who reveal beauty and conceal ugly things!
O You who do not take a wrongdoer to task and do not tear the veil!
O You who are Great Forgiver! O You who have the great forbearance!
O You who have pardon abounding! O You who have opened Your hands for mercy!
O Hearer of all whisperings! O You to whom all complaints are made!

53,Dua Zakhira,It is narrated from the Infallibles (a.s.) that they said: Verily for all the Ahle Bayts there is a treasure and our treasure is the following Supplication:,"O Allah, indeed I ask you, O One Who is what He is. And there is nothing like Him except Himself. O One Who does not know what He is except that He is. O One Whom nothing can make helpless, and nothing is a replacement for Him, and He is the Creator of everything, and the One Who controls everything, and One in Whose control is everything, the dominant One over everything, Who destroyed the tyrants by His power. One Who demands worship of the creatures by His power. O You are the One for whom every forehead bows. And all the beings submit to Your lordship, the closest and the distant ones…
You know the apparent and the hidden and what is there from everything more hidden. O One Who knows the blinks of the eyes and what the hearts conceal in the depths of the secrets. O One Who knows what was and what will be. O One in Whose control is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. O One Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. O One in Whose control is the kingdom of everything. And He is such that nothing could oppress Him. Save us by Your kindness from whatever we fear. And convey to us what we hope for. O One on Whom is not hidden the most subtle and the most hidden and the most revered of the revered. O master! The hopes are cut off except from You…

That You bless Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad and that You fulfill my need, and that You convey me to my safety, and fulfill my hopes, then I indeed ask You and I know that You are the great Lord, One Whom nothing can make helpless when You have intended it. O Allah, indeed I pass the day and night in Your kingdom and Your protection, then give me recompense. O Allah, and my family and my children, whom You have created and what You created. O the great One. “And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them over so that they do not see.” In the name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful…
There is no god except Allah, He is the living, the eternal. O Allah then by them and by Your names greater than them. Place us in the refuge and shield from everything we dread, and from the mischief of the ruler and the mischief of the Satan and the mischief of all the beasts and quadrupeds and crawling creatures and the darknesses of the night and the coming out of the day, and from all the concealed matters that I fear. And my courage is in Your hope and all my reliance is on Your reward, then do not deprive me of what I hope for. By there is no god except You, O there is no god except You, by there is no god except You. Save me from all that I fear and fulfill all my needs.
And convey to me by Your power what I hope. And one who has oppressed me or whom I fear from the ruler or Satan or all the men, then is appointed ‘there is no god except You’ on his heart.

O He who is high and exalted in glory and greatness, having no equal in distinction and eminence.

O He in answer to whose call stood firm the heavens and the earths.

O He who, very kindly, with delicate fineness, gave brightness to the moon, to spread soft light I the gloomy dark night.

55,Dua Arafah,"The supplicatory prayer of Imam al-Husayn (`a), the Chief of Martyrs, on the `Arafat Day is one of the famous prayers. Bishr and Bashir, the sons of Ghalib al-Asadi, narrated that they, once, accompanied Imam al-Husayn (`a) at the `Arafat Night when he left his tent with submission and reverence. He walked slowly until he, accompanied by a group of his household, sons, and servants, stopped at the left side of Mount `Arafat and turned his face towards the Holy Ka`bah. He then raised his hands (for supplication) to the level of his face, just like a poor man begging food, and said","Praise be to Allah Whose determination cannot be repelled by anything, Whose gifts cannot be stopped by anything, and Whose making cannot be resembled by the making of anyone. He is the All-magnanimous, the All-liberal. He originated the genus of the wonderfully created things and He perfected the made things by His wisdom. All growing things cannot be hidden from Him and all things deposited with Him shall never be wasted.  He is the Repayer on every deed, the Enricher of every satisfied one, the Merciful toward every suppliant, and the Revealer of the benefits and the All-comprehensive Book with the glaring light. He is also the Hearer of prayers, the Warder-off of anguishes, the Raiser of ranks, and the Suppressor of the tyrants. There is no god other than Him and there is nothing equivalent to Him and nothing like a likeness of Him, and He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing, the All-gentle, the All-aware, and He has power over all things. O Allah, I willingly desire for You and I testify to the Lordship of You, confessing that You are verily my Lord and to You shall be my return. You had begun bestowing on me before I was anything worth mentioning, and You created me from dust. You then put me up in the loins, (making me) saved from vicissitudes of time, and change of ages and years. I was moving from a loin to a womb throughout the passage of the past days and the ancient ages; as You have not taken me out (to this world)—on account of Your sympathy to me, Your kindness to me, and Your compassion to me— in the government of the heads of unbelief who breached their covenant with You and denied Your messengers. However, You took me out on account of the guidance that You have already known about me and You have made easy the way to it and You have brought me up in it. Even before that, You had compassion on me, through Your excellent conferral and Your affluent bestowals. So, You fashioned my creation from semen that gushed forth and put me up in triple darkness among flesh, blood, and skin. You have not made me witness my creation, and You have not referred any part of my creation to me. You then took me out on account of the guidance that You have already known about me to the world, perfect and in sound health. You have safeguarded me in the cradle as small child. You have provided me with wholesome milk as food. You have made the hearts of the nursemaids tender. You have given me into the charge of merciful mothers. You have saved me from the visits of the Jinn. You have delivered me from increase and decrease. So, Exalted be You, O All-merciful, O All-beneficent. When I commenced (my life) by pronouncing words, You perfected for me the affluent bestowals, and brought me up with an increase every year. When my creation was accomplished, and my power became straight, You put me under the obligation of Your Claim, which is that You inspired me with recognition of You and alarmed me by the wonders of Your wisdom, and You aroused in me that which You created in Your heavens and lands, which is the excellent creation of You. You attracted my attentions to thank and mention You. You made obligatory on me to obey and worship You. You made me understand that with which Your Apostles came. You made easy for me to find agreeable Your pleasure. You bestowed upon me with the favor of all that, out of Your aid and Your gentleness. As You created me from the best of soil, You, my God, have not wanted for me to have a certain favor (and to be deprived of another) and You therefore provided me with the various kinds of living and types of wealth, out of Your great and grand conferral upon me, and Your eternal kindness to me. As You perfected for me all the graces and warded off all misfortunes, my ignorance of You and challenge have not stopped You from showing me that which takes me near to You, and from leading me to that which grants me proximity to You. So, if I pray You, You will respond to me; and if I beg You, You will give me; and if I obey You, You will thank me; and if I thank You, You will give me more. All that is completion of Your favors for me, and Your kindness to me. So, all glory be to You; all glory be to You. You are verily Originator and Reproducer (of the creation) and worthy of all praise and full of all glory. Holy be Your Names as Your bounties are so immeasurable. Which of Your favors, O my God, can I count in numbers and examples? Or which of Your gifts can I thank properly? They are, O my Lord, too numerous to be counted by counters or to be realized by memorizers. Moreover, that which You have warded off and repelled, O Allah, from (the various kinds of) harm and mischief is more than that which came to me from wellbeing and joy. And I bear witness, O my God, with my true belief, and the fortitude of the determinations of my conviction and the purity of my open belief in Your Oneness and the essence of the secret of my conscience, and the ties of the canals of the light of my sight, and the lines of my forehead and the hallows of the courses of my breath, and the (nasal) cavities of my nose, and the courses of the meatus of my hearing, and whatever my two lips hide and cover up, and the motions of the vocalization of my tongue, and the socket of the palate of my mouth and jaw, and the matrices of my dents, and the tasting of my food and my drink, and the carrier of my skill, and the tube of the tissues of my neck and what is included by the cloak of my chest, and the carriers of the cord of my aorta, and the cords of the pericardium of my heart, and the pieces of the retinues of my liver, and that which is included by the cartilages of my ribs, and the cavities of my joints, and the interactings of my organisms, and the extremes of my fingertips, and my flesh, and my blood, and my hair, and my skin, and my nerve, and my sinews, and my bones, and my brain, and my veins, and all of my organs, and that which was pieced together during the days of my suckling, and whatever of my body that the ground carries, and my sleeping, and my wakefulness, and my motionlessness, and the movements of my bowing and prostration; (by all that I bear witness) that if I try my best and strive throughout all ages and all times, if I live them, to thank properly only one of Your favors, I will not be able to do that, except through a favor of You, which also requires me to thank You for it, once again with new thanking and with praise that is newly acquired and newly prepared. True is this! And if I try hard, as well as the counters from Your creatures, to count the scope of Your favoring, both the past and the present, we shall never be able to calculate it in number, or count it in time. Too far is this! How can it be! While it is You Who have informed in Your rational Book and true news: “And if you count Allah's favors, you will not be able to number them.” True is Your Book, O Allah, and Your informing. Your Prophets and Messengers have conveyed what You revealed to them, from Your Revelation, and what You have made plain for them and through them Your religion. Nevertheless, O my God, I bear witness by my ultimate possibility and my diligence and the scope of my vigor and my capacity, and I say with full faith and conviction: All praise be to Allah Who has not taken to Himself a son to be inherited, and Who does not have a partner in His kingdom, to oppose Him in what He fashions, and Who does not have a helper to save Him from disgrace, to help Him in what He makes. So, glory be to Him, glory be to Him. If there had been in them any gods except Allah, they would both have certainly been in a state of disorder and destruction. All glory be to Allah, the One, the Only One, the Besought of all, Who begets not nor is He begotten, and there is none like Him. All praise be to Allah—praise that is equal to the praise of His Favorite Angels, and His missioned Prophets. May Allah send blessings to His Select, Muhammad, the Seal of Prophets, and upon his Household, the pure, immaculate, and well-chosen, and may He send benedictions upon them.  The Imam (`a) then besought Almighty Allah so earnestly that his eyes shed tears. He then said:   O Allah, (please) make me fear You as if I can see You. Make happy by fearing You. Do not make me unhappy by disobeying You. Choose for me through Your decree. Bless me through Your determination, so that I will not long for hastening that which You have delayed or delaying that which You would hasten. O Allah, (please) make my richness in my conscience, conviction in my hear, sincerity in my deeds, light in my sight, and insight in my religion. Make me find enjoyment in my organs. Make my hearing and my sight sound until I am inherited. Grant me victory over him who wrongs me, make me witness my avenge and objective in him,  and make it the delight of my eye. O Allah, (please) relieve my agony, conceal my flaws, forgive my sin, drive away my devil from me, redeem my mortgage, and decide for me, O my God, the supreme rank in the Hereafter and in the former (life). O Allah, all praise be to You for You have created me and made me hear and see. All praise be to You for you have created me and made my creation perfect, on account of Your having mercy on me, and You could dispense with creating me. O my Lord, as You gave rise to me and perfected my creation; O my Lord, as You originated me and did well my form; O my Lord, as You conferred favors on me and granted me wellbeing in my self; O my Lord, as You saved me and led me to success; O my Lord, as You bestowed favors on me and guided me; O my Lord, as You presented me and gave me from every good; O my Lord, as you fed me and watered me; O my Lord, as You enriched me and gave me to hold; O my Lord, as You helped me and braced me; O my Lord, as you clothed me from Your pure cover and made easy for me Your adequate making, so, (please) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, help me against calamities of ages and changes of nights and days, rescue me from the horrors of this world and the anguishes of the Hereafter, and save me from the evils of what the wrongdoers do in the earth. O Allah, as to what I anticipate, (please) save me (from it). As to what I watch out, (please) protect me (against it). Safeguard me in my soul and religion, watch over me in my journeys, be in charge of my family members and properties during my absence, bless me in that which You provide as sustenance, make me see myself as humble, make people see me as great, keep me sound from the evils of the Jinn and people, do not disclose me because of my sins, do not disgrace me because of the secret side (of myself), do not try me in my deeds, do not deprive me of Your bounties, and do not refer me to anyone other than You. To whom do You entrust me? To a relative, and he will rupture my relation with him! Or to a strange, and he will glower at me! Or to those who deem me weak! While You are my Lord and the master of my affairs! I complain to You about my alienation and my foreignness and my ignominy in the eyes of him whom You have given domination over me. So, O my God, do not make Your wrath come upon me. If You are not wrathful with me, then I care for nothing save You. All glory be to You; yet, Your granting me wellbeing is more favorable for me. So, I beseech You, O my Lord, in the name of the Light of Your Face to which the earth and the heavens have shone, by which all darkness has been uncovered, and by which the affairs of the past and the coming generations are made right, (please) do not cause me to die while You are wrathful with me and do not inflict on me Your rage. You have the right to scold; You have the right to scold; until You are pleased (with me) before that. There is no god save You; Lord of the Holy City,  the Holy Monument, and the Ancient House that You have encompassed with blessing and made security for people. O He Who pardoned the grand sins by His forbearance! O He Who bestowed bounties by His favoring! O He Who gave in abundance by His generosity! O my means in my hardship! O my companion in my loneliness! O my relief in my agony! O my Benefactor in my amenities! O my God and the God of my forefathers: Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob; the Lord of Gabriel, Michael, and Seraph; the Lord of Muhammad, the Seal of Prophets, and his elite Household; the Revealer of the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and the Furqan; the Revealer of kaf-ha-ya-`ayn-sad and ta-ha, ya-sin, and the Qur'an, full of wisdom. You are my haven when the wide courses fail to carry me and when the earth, despite its width, become too narrow to bear me. Without Your mercy, I would have been of those perishing. You overlook my slips; and without Your covering me, I would have been of those exposed.  You aid me with Your support against my enemies; and without Your support, I would have been of those overwhelmed. O He Who gives Himself exclusively superiority and highness; so, His friends pride themselves on account of His pride. O He for Whom the kings put the yoke of humiliation on their necks; for they are fearful of His authority. He knows the stealthy looks of eyes and that which the breasts conceal and the future of the times and ages. O He save Whom none knows how He is! O He save Whom none knows what He is! O He save Whom none knows what He knows! O He Who surfaced the earth over the water and blocked the air with the heavens! O He Who has the noblest of names! O Owner of favor that is never interrupted! O He Who directed the caravan towards Joseph in the wasteland,  took him out of the pit, and made him king after enslavement! O He Who had returned him to Jacob after his eyes became white on account of the grief, and he was a repressor of grief! O He Who removed the distress and misfortune from Job and withheld the hands of Abraham from slaying his son after his old age and termination of his lifetime! O He Who responded to Zachariah and granted him John without leaving him alone and lonely! O He Who took Jonah out of the belly of the big fish! O He Who cleft the sea to the children of Israel; so, He saved them and made Pharaoh and his army of the drowned! O He Who sent the winds, bearing good news, before His mercy! O He Who has no hastiness on His creatures who disobey Him! O He Who saved the sorcerers after their long denial! and after they had lived in His bounty, eating from His sustenance, but serving someone else other than Him, acting in opposition to Him, antagonizing Him, and denying His messengers. O Allah! O Allah! O Originator! O Fashioner! There is no equal to You. O Everlasting! There is no end to You. O Ever-living when there was no living thing! O Raiser from the dead! O He Who watches every soul as to what it earns! O He to Whom I rarely turned thankful; yet, He did not deprive me, against Whom I committed grand sins; yet, He did not disclose me, and Who saw me insisting on disobeying Him; yet, He did not divulge me. O He Who safeguarded me in my early life! O He Who provided me with sustenance in my old age! O He Whose favors to me are innumerable and Whose bounties cannot be compensated! O He Who receives me with good turn and kindness but I meet Him with offense and disobedience! O He Who had guided me to faith before I learnt showing gratitude! O He Whom I besought in sickness; so, He restored me to health, in bareness; so, He covered me, in hunger; so, He satiated me, in thirst; so, He quenched my thirst, in humility; so, He granted me dignity, in ignorance; so, He taught me, in loneliness; so, He increased my number, in foreignness absence; so, He returned me home,  in poverty; so, He enriched me, in victory-seeking; so, He supported me, and in richness; so, He did not deprive me. When I withheld praying Him in all these situation, He took the initiative. So, all praise and thanks be to You; O He Who overlooked my slips, relieved my agonies, responded to my prayer, covered my flaws, forgave my sins, settled my need, and supported me against my enemy. If I count Your bounties, favors, and liberal gifts, I will never number them. O my Master! It is You Who bestowed (upon me). It is You Who conferred favors (upon me). It is You Who did good (to me). It is You Who treated (me) excellently. It is You Who favored (me). It is You Who perfected (Your blessings upon me). It is You Who provided (me) with sustenance. It is You Who led (me) to success. It is You Who gave (me). It is You Who enriched (me). It is You Who gave (me) to hold. It is You Who gave (me) shelter. It is You Who saved (me). It is You Who guided (me). It is You Who protected (me). It is You Who covered my faults. It is You Who forgave (me). It is You Who overlooked my sins. It is You Who established (me). It is You Who consolidated (me). It is You Who helped (me). It is You Who backed (me) up. It is You Who aided (me). It is You Who supported (me). It is You Who restored (me) to health. It is You Who granted (me) wellbeing. It is You Who honored (me). Blessed be You and Exalted be You. So, all praise be to You permanently, and all thanks be to You enduringly and eternally. However, it is I, O my God, who confess of my sins; so, (please) forgive them to me. It is I who did badly. It is I who did wrong. It is I who had evil intention. It is I who acted impolitely. It is I who was inadvertent. It is I who was inattentive. It is I who leaned (on something other than You). It is I who did wrong deliberately. It is I who promised. It is I who failed to fulfill it. It is I who breached. It is I who confessed. It is I who testified to Your favors upon and with me, and I now acknowledge of my sins; so, (please) forgive them to me. O He Who is not injured by the sins of His servants, and Who can surely do without their obedience, and Who inspires those of them to do good, out of His aid and mercy. So, all praise be to You, O my God and my Master. O my God: You ordered me, but I disobeyed You. You warned me, but I violated Your warning. So, I am now lacking neither justification to apologize nor power to support myself. By which thing can I now meet You, O my Master? Is it by my hearing, my sight, my tongue, my hand, or my foot? Are all these not Your bounties on me and with all of them I have disobeyed You, O my Master? You have absolute argument and claim against me. O He Who covered me from fathers and mothers lest they might have driven me away, from relatives and friends lest they might have gibed me, and from rulers lest they might have punished me. Had they, O my Master, seen that which You knew about me, they would certainly have granted me no respite and they would have rejected and parted company with me. Here I am now, O my God, between Your hands, O my Master, submissive, humble, helpless, and worthless. I am now lacking neither justification to apologize nor power to support myself, nor excuse to advance as a plea, nor can I claim not committing and not acting badly. How can denial, if I deny, O my Master, serve me? How and in what manner can I do so, while all my organs are witnesses for what I did? I know for sure and without doubt that You will interrogate me about these grand matter, You are the Just Judge Who never wrongs, Your justice will ruin me, and from Your all justice I flee. If You, O my God, chastise me, then it is because of my sins after Your claim against me; and if You pardon me, then it is on account of Your forbearance, magnanimity, and generosity. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of the wrongdoers. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those seeking forgiveness. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those professing Your Oneness. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of the fearful. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of the apprehensive. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those hoping (for You). There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those desiring (for You). There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those professing that there is no god save You. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those beseeching (You). There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those glorifying (You). There is no god save You. All glory be to You. I have been of those professing that You are the Greatest. There is no god save You. All glory be to You. You are my Lord and the Lord of my bygone fathers. O Allah, this is my praise for You, celebrating Your glory, my sincerity to mention You and profess Your Oneness, and my acknowledgment of Your bounties, counting them, although I confess that I could never count them for they are innumerable, abundant, continuous, and prior to a certain event. You have been conferring upon me with these bounties since You created and originated me from the beginning of my age through meeting my poverty relieving me from harm, giving me means of easiness, repelling misery from me, alleviating my agonies, granting me wellbeing in my body, and furnishing me with sound faith. If all creatures assist me to be able to mention Your bounties,  including the past and the coming generations, neither I nor will they be able to do that. Holy be You and Exalted be You; You are All-generous, All-great, and All-merciful Sustainer. Your bounties are innumerable, (proper) praise of You is unreachable, and Your graces cannot be rewarded. (Please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, perfect Your bounties for us, and make us happy by obeying You. All glory be to You. There is no god save You. O Allah, verily, You answer the distressed, remove the evil, aid the anguished, cure the ailed, enrich the poor, set the broken, have mercy on the young, help the old, none can help against You, none is more powerful than You, and You are the Most High, the All-great. O He Who release the shackled captive! O He Who provides sustenance to the young child! O He Who is the Preserver of the afraid seeker of refuge! O He Who has neither partner nor assistant, (please) send blessings to Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, and grant me, in this evening, the best of what You have granted and awarded to any of Your servants, including a grace that You donate, bounties that You re-offer, a tribulation that You deter, an anguish that You remove, a prayer that You answer, a good deed that You admit, and an evildoing that You screen. Verily, You are All-tender to him You will, and All-aware, and You have power over all things. O Allah, Verily, You are the nearest of those whom are prayed, You are the promptest of those who may respond, the most generous of those who may pardon, the most liberal of those who give, and the most responding of those whom are asked. O All-beneficent of the world and the Hereafter, and All-merciful! No besought one is like You and none save You is hoped. I prayed You and You answered me. I besought You and You gave me. I desired for You and You had mercy on me. I had confidence in You and You saved me. I resorted to You in awe and You delivered me. O Allah, (please) send blessings to Muhammad, Your servant, messenger, and prophet, and to all of his Household, the pure and immaculate, and perfect for us Your graces, make us taste the pleasure of Your gifts, and register us as thankful for You and as oft-referring to You. Respond, respond! O Lord of the worlds! O Allah, Who owns; therefore, He controls, and controls; therefore, He has absolute authority, and is disobeyed; yet, He covers, and is prayed for forgiveness; therefore, He forgives. O He Who is the aim of seekers and desirers and the ultimate purpose of the hope of hopers! O He Who encompasses all things in knowledge and covers those who quit (their sins) with tender, mercy, and forbearance! O Allah, we turn our faces to You in this evening that You deem honorable and reverential (asking You) in the name of Muhammad, Your Prophet, Messenger, the best of Your creation, Your trustee on Your Revelation, the bearer of glad tidings, the warner, and the shining lantern, with whom You have conferred upon the Muslims, and whom You made mercy for the worlds. So, O Allah, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, forasmuch as Muhammad deserves that from You, O All-great. So, (please) send blessings to him and his Household, the elite, pure, and immaculate—all of them, and encompass us with Your pardoning us. To You are the voices of various languages clamoring; so, decide for us, O Allah, in this evening a share from every good item that You distribute among Your servants, illumination by which You guide,  mercy that You spread, blessing that You bring down, wellbeing that You extend, and sustenance that You stretch, O most Merciful of all those who show mercy! O Allah, turn us in this hour successful, flourishing, blessed, and gainers. Do not include us with the despondent. Do not leave us without Your mercy. Do not deprive us of that which we hope from Your favor. Do not make us deprived of Your mercy, or despair of the favor of what we hope from Your gifts. Do not turns us down disappointed or driven away from Your door. O most Magnanimous of all those who treat magnanimously and most Generous of all those who act generously! To You are we advancing with full conviction and to Your Holy House are we betaking ourselves purposefully; So, (please) help us do our rituals (perfectly) perfect for us our pilgrimage pardon us, and grant us wellbeing. We are stretching our hands toward You; so, they are marked by the humiliation of confession. O Allah, grant us in this evening that which we have besought from You and save us from that which we have besought You to save us; for we have no savior but You and we have no sustainer but You. Your decree is prevalent on us, Your knowledge is encompassing us, and Your decisions about us is just. (Please) decree for us that which is good and make us of the people of goodness. O Allah, decide for us, on account of Your magnanimity, a great reward, a generous reserve, and a permanent easiness, and forgive us all our sins, do not annihilate us with those annihilated, and do not drive away from us Your tenderness and mercy; O most Merciful of all those who show mercy! O Allah, include us, at this hour, with them who besought You and You thus gave them, who thanked You and You thus increased them, who returned to You and You thus accepted them, and who renounced all their sins before You and You thus forgave them; O Lord of Majesty and Honor! O Allah, purify us and lead us to success and admit our earnest entreaty; O He Who is the best of all those who are besought and most Merciful of all those whose mercy is sought! O He from Whom the closing of eyelids cannot be hidden, nor are the glances of eyes, nor is that which settles in the unseen, nor are things vanished under the secrets of hearts. Verily, all that has been encompassed by Your knowledge and covered by Your forbearance. All glory be to You; and Exalted be You above all that the wrongdoers say, in high exaltation! Declaring You glory are the seven heavens, the (layers of the) earth, and all beings therein.  There is not a thing but celebrates Your praise. Yours are all praise, glory, and exaltation of majesty. O Owner of majesty, honor, grace, favoring, and huge bestowals. You are the All-magnanimous, the All-generous, the All-tender, the All-merciful. O Allah, provide me largely with Your legally gotten sustenance, grant me wellbeing in my body and my faith, secure my fears, and release me from Hellfire. O Allah, (please) do not plan against me, do not draw me near to destruction, do not overreach me, and drive away from me the evils of the corruptive Jinn and men.  Imam al-Husayn (`a) then repeated ya-rabbi so frequently and effectively that he attracted the attentions of all the others who, instead of praying for granting their needs, surrounded Imam al-°usayn (`a) to listen to him and pray for the response of his supplication. Then, they wept with him. At sunset, they left Mount `Arafat with him. This is the end of Imam al-Husayn’s supplicatory prayer on the `Arafat Day according to the narrations of al-Kaf`ami in his book of al-Balad al-Amin and `Allamah al-Majlisi in his book of Zad al-Ma`ad. As for Sayyid Ibn Tawus, he, in his book of Iqbal al-A`mal, adds the following statements to the supplicatory prayer:  O my God, I am needy despite my richness; so, how can I not be needy in my neediness? O my God, I am ignorant despite my knowledge; so, how can I not be ignorant in my ignorance? O my God, the variety of Your regulating of matters and the swiftness of changes in Your ordainments have urged Your servants, who recognize You, not to stop at a certain gift and not to despair of You in tribulations. O my God, coming out of me is that which fits my lowliness; but coming from You is that which befits Your nobleness. O my God, You had ascribed to Yourself gentleness and kindness to me before the existence of my weakness. Will You deprive me of these two after the emergence of my weakness? O my God, if amenities appear in my conduct, then that is on account of Your favors and Your conferral on me. If evildoings appear in my conduct, then that is still Your justice and You have claim against me. O my God, how may it be that You abandon me after You have vouched for me? How may I be aggrieved and You are my support? How may I be disappointed and You are undertaking my affairs? Here I am begging You by my need for You. How can I beg You by something that is impossible to reach You? How can I complain to You about my manners while they cannot be hidden from You? How can I interpret my words while You are their source? How come that You may let down my hopes, while they are addressed to You? How come that You may not improve my conditions while they are originated by You? O my God, how gentle You are to me despite my notorious ignorance! How merciful You are to me despite my hideous deeds! O my God, how nigh to me You are and how far from You I am! How kind to me You are; so, what is that which can prevent me from You? O my God, I have known, through variety of signs and changes of phases, that what You want from me is that You introduce Yourself to me in all things so that I will not ignore You in any thing. O my God, whenever my lowliness suppresses my voice, Your nobility encourages me to speak. Whenever my features lead me to despair (of You), Your bestowals make me crave for You. O my God, as for he whose good deeds are wrongdoings; how can his wrongdoings not be wrongdoings? As for he whose facts are mere claims, how can his claims not be claims? O my God, Your unstoppable decree and Your surmounting volition have not left any word to be said by any orator and have not left any manner to be displayed. O my God, too many are the acts of obedience that I have prepared and the conducts that I have established, but Your justice has ruined my reliance on these, and, moreover, Your favoring has made me abandon them. O my God, You surely know that even my obedience (to You) has not lasted in reality, it has lasted in love (for it) and determination (to do it)! O my God, how can I determine, while You are All-supreme? How can I quit determining, while it is Your command (to determine)? O my God, my hesitation in (following) Your traces will result in unlikely visitation; so, (please) join me to You through a service that takes me to You. How can You be figured out through that whose existence relies on You? Can any thing other than You hold a (kind of) manifestation that You lack and thus it may act as an appearance for You? When have You ever been absent so that You may need something to point to You? When have You ever been far-off so that traces may lead to You? Blind be the eye that cannot see You watching it. Losing is a servant’s deal that does not dedicate a share to the love for You. O my God, You have ordered us to refer to the traces; therefore, (please do) make me refer to You with the garb of lights and the guidance of insight so that I will return to You in the same way as I have entered to You from them as being too protected to look at them and too determining to depend upon them, for You have power over all things. O my God, this is my humiliation; it manifests itself before You. This is my manner; it cannot be concealed against You. From You do I beseech soaring to You and through You do I take the way to You. So, (please do) guide me to You through Your Light and make me stand up before Your Hands with the true servitude to You. O my God, (please do) teach me from Your veiled knowledge and protect me with Your shielding shelter. O my God, (please do) grant me the realities that are enjoyed by the people who are near to You and make me follow the course of the people who are attracted to You. O my God, make Your management of my affairs replace my management of my affairs, make Your choice for me replace my choice for myself, and make me stop at the points of emergency. O my God, (please do) take my out of the humiliation of myself and purify me from my suspicion and polytheism before I enter my grave. Only through You do I achieve victory; so, (please do) give me victory. Only upon You do I rely; so, do not refer me to anyone else. Only You do I beseech; so, do not disappoint me. Only for Your favors do I desire; so, do not deprive me (of Your favors). Only to Your side do I resort; so, do not set me aside. At Your door only do I stand; so, do not drive me away. O my God, Your pleasure is too sanctified to receive a defect from You; hence, how can it receive a defect from me? O my God, You are too self-sufficient by Yourself to be benefited by Yourself; hence, how can You not be self-sufficient from me? O my God, fate awakens my hope and whim has enchained me with the firm chains of lust; so, (please do) be my Supporter so that You shall back me and show me the right path. And (please do) help me (to dispense with anyone else) through Your favors so that I shall depend upon You exclusively in my requests. It is You Who have lit the illuminations in the hearts of Your intimate servants so that they have recognized and testified Your Oneness. It is You Who have removed love for others from the hearts of Your lovers so that they have loved none save You and they have resorted to none save You. You alone are entertaining them  when they have felt lonely because of the other worlds. You alone have guided them so that all other worlds manifested themselves before them. What can one who misses You find any substitute? What can one who finds You miss anything else? Definitely, failing is he who has accepted anyone other than You as substitute. Definitely, loser is he who have desired for anyone other than You. How can anyone other than You be hoped whilst You have never stopped Your bounties? How can anyone other than You be besought whilst You have never changed Your habit of ceaseless bestowal? O He Who has made His lovers the sweet taste of entertainment; therefore, they have stood up before Him flattering Him! O He Who has dressed His intimate servants the garments of fearing Him; therefore, they have stood before Him seeking His forgiveness! You do mention the others (with bounties) before they mention You. You do spread Your compassion before the worshippers direct towards You. You do give generously before You are asked. You do bestow upon us and then borrow from us that which You have bestowed upon us. O my God, (please do) refer to me with Your mercy so that I will appear before You. (Please do) draw me towards You through Your endless favoring so that I will advance to You. O my God, verily, my hope for You does not cease despite that I may disobey You. Similarly, my fear from You does not leave me even if I obey You. The Worlds have pushed me towards You and my acquaintance with Your magnanimity has led me to You. O my God, how can I fail whilst You are my hope? How can I be humiliated whilst I depend upon You? How can see dignity if You fix me in humiliation? How can I not see dignity whilst You have referred me to You? O my God, how can I not be needy whilst it is You Who have lodged me among the needy? How can I be needy whilst You have made me rich out of Your magnanimity? It is You, there is no god save You, Who have introduced Yourself to all things; therefore, nothing has ever ignored You. It is You Who have introduced Yourself to me in all things; therefore, I have seen You Manifest in all things. It is You Who give manifestation to all things. O He Who is firm in power through His All-beneficence; therefore, the Throne has become unseen in His Essence. You have erased the traces by the traces; and You have erased the changeable by the surroundings of the orbits of lights. O He Who has screened Himself in the curtains of His Throne; hence, He cannot be comprehended by visions! O He Who has manifested Himself with His perfect Magnificence; therefore, His Grandeur of being firm in power. How can You be hidden whilst You are the Manifester (of all things)? Or how can You be absent whilst You are the Watcher (over all things) and the Present (at all times). Verily, You have power over all things. All praise be to Allah alone.

56,Dua Tauba,"This Du'a is taught by the fourth Imam (a) and is Du'a #31 in Saheefa as­sajjadiyyah. The du'a is a touching plea by one who acknowledges the enormity of the sins he has committed. His hope lies only in the mercy and forgiveness of Allah.

Using Qur'anic concepts of repentance, and its acceptance, Imam teaches us how to be sincere in seeking it. The Du'a reiterates the conditions of repentance, the physical signs present on a true repenter, and the legitimate hopes given to one who truly seeks forgiveness. It is a beautifully elegant way of expressing the remorse and hope of a faithful believer who has sinned.","O God,
O He whom the depiction of the describers
fails to describe!

O He beyond whom passes not
the hope of the hopers!

O He with whom is not lost
the wage of the good-doers!

O He who is the ultimate object
of the fear of the worshipers!

O He who is the utmost limit
of the dread of the god-fearing!

This is the station of him
whom sins have passed from hand to hand.
Offenses' reins have led him on,
and Satan has gained mastery over him.
He fell short of what Thou hast commanded
through neglect
and he pursued what Thou hast prohibited
in delusion,

like one ignorant of Thy power over him
or one who denies the bounty of Thy beneficence toward him,
until, when the eye of guidance was opened for him
and the clouds of blindness were dispelled,
he reckoned that through which he had wronged himself
and reflected upon that in which he had opposed his Lord.
He saw his vast disobedience as vast
and his great opposition as great.

So turned to Thee,
hoping in Thee
and ashamed before Thee,
and he directed his beseeching toward Thee,
having trust in Thee.
He repaired to Thee in his longing
with certitude
and he went straight to Thee in fear
with sincerity.
His longing was devoid of every object of longing but Thee,
and his fright departed from every object of fear but Thee.

So he stood before Thee pleading,
his eyes turned toward the ground in humbleness,
his head bowed before Thy might in lowliness;
he revealed to Thee in meekness
those secrets of his which Thou knowest better than he;
he numbered for Thee in humility
those sins of his which Thou countest better than he;
he sought help from Thee
before the dreadful into which he has fallen
in Thy knowledge
and the ugly which has disgraced him
in Thy judgement:
the sins
whose pleasures have turned their backs
and gone
and whose evil consequences have stayed
and stuck fast.

He will not deny Thy justice, my God,
if Thou punishest him,
nor will he consider Thy pardon great
if Thou pardonest him and hast mercy upon him,
for Thou art the Generous Lord
for whom the forgiveness of great sins
is nothing great!

O God,
so here I am:
I have come to Thee
obeying Thy command
(for Thou hast commanded supplication)
and asking the fulfillment of Thy promise,
(for Thou hast promised to respond)
Thou hast said,
Supplicate Me and I will respond to you.127

O God,
so bless Muhammad and his Household,
meet me with Thy forgiveness
just as I have met Thee with my confession,
lift me up from the fatal infirmities of sins
just as I have let myself down before Thee,
and cover me with Thy covering
just as Thou hast shown no haste to take vengeance on me!

O God,
make firm my intention to obey Thee,
strengthen my insight in worshipping Thee,
give me the success of works
which will wash away the defilement of offenses,
and take me when Thou takest me
in the creed of Thy prophet Muhammad
(upon him be peace).

O God,
I repent to Thee in this my station from
my sins,
great and small,
my evil deeds,
inward and outward,
my lapses,
past and recent,
with the repentance of one who does not
tell himself that he might disobey
or secretly think that he might return to an offense.

Thou hast said, my God,
in the firm text of Thy Book,
that Thou acceptest repentance from Thy servants,128
pardonest evil deeds,129
and lovest the repenters,130
so accept my repentance
as Thou hast promised,
pardon my evil deeds
as thou hast guaranteed,
and make obligatory toward me Thy love
as Thou hast stipulated!

To Thee, my Lord, belongs
my stipulation
that I will not return
to what is disliked by Thee,
my guarantee
that I will not go back
to what Thou blamest,
and my covenant
that I will stay away
from acts of disobedience to Thee.

O God,
Thou knowest better what I have done,
so forgive me what Thou knowest
and turn me through Thy power to what Thou lovest!

O God,
counted against me are
claims that stay in my memory
and claims that I have forgotten,
while all of them remain in
Thy eye that does not sleep
and Thy knowledge that does not forget!
So compensate their owners,
lighten their load upon me,
lift up their weight from me,
and preserve me from approaching their like!

O God,
but I can not be faithful to my repentance
without Thy preservation,
nor can I refrain from offenses
without Thy strength.
So strengthen me with a sufficient strength
and attend to me with a defending preservation!

O God,
if any servant repents to Thee,
while in Thy knowledge of the Unseen he
will break his repentance
and return to his sin and offense,
I seek refuge in Thee lest I be like that!
So make this my repentance
a repentance
after which I will need no repentance
and a repentance
which will obligate the erasing of what has gone by
and safety in what remains!

O God,
I ask pardon from Thee for my ignorance,
and I ask Thee to disregard my evil acts!
So join me to the shelter of Thy mercy
through graciousness
and cover me with the covering of Thy well-being
through bounteousness!

O God,
I repent to Thee from everything opposed to Thy will
or far from Thy love
- the thoughts of my heart,
the glances of my eye,
the tales of my tongue -
with a repentance through which each bodily part will by itself
stay safe from ill consequences with Thee
and remain secure from Thy painful penalties
feared by transgressors!

O God,
so have mercy on
my being alone before Thee,
the pounding of my heart in dread of Thee,
the trembling of my limbs in awe of Thee!
My sins, my God, have stood me in the station
of degradation in Thy courtyard.
If I remain silent,
none will speak for me;
if I seek an intercessor,
I am not worthy for intercession.

O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
make Thy generosity intercede for my offenses,
follow up my evil deeds with Thy pardon,
repay me not with the punishment that is my proper repayment,
spread over me Thy graciousness,
wrap me in Thy covering,
and do with me what is done
by a mighty man,
when a lowly slave pleads to him
and he shows him mercy,
or a rich man,
when a poor slave submits himself
and he raises him to wealth!

O God,
I have no protector against Thee,
so let Thy might be my protector!
I have no intercessor with Thee,
so let Thy bounty be my intercessor!
My offenses have set me quaking,
so let Thy pardon give me security!

Not all that I have said rises up from
my ignorance of my evil footsteps
or forgetfulness of my blameworthy acts in the past,
but in order that Thy heaven and those within it
and Thy earth and those upon it
may hear the remorse which I have professed to Thee
and the repentance through which I have sought asylum with Thee.

Then perhaps one of them, through Thy mercy,
may show mercy upon my evil situation
or be seized by tenderness for my evil state.
There may come from him for my sake
a supplication to which Thou givest ear
more than to my supplication
or an intercession surer with Thee
than my intercession
through which I may be delivered from Thy wrath
and attain to Thy good pleasure!

O God,
if remorse is a repentance toward Thee,131
then I am the most remorseful of the remorseful!
If refraining from disobedience is a turning back to Thee,
then I am the first of those who turn back!
If praying for forgiveness alleviates sins,
surely I am one of those who pray for Thy forgiveness!

O God,
as Thou hast commanded repentance
and guaranteed acceptance,
as Thou hast urged supplication,
and promised to respond,
so also bless Muhammad and his Household,
accept my repentance,
and return me not to the returning place
of disappointment in Thy mercy!
Surely Thou art Ever-turning toward the sinners,
All-compassionate132 toward the offenders who turn back!

O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household
just as Thou hast guided us by him!
Bless Muhammad and his Household
just as Thou hast rescued us through him!133
Bless Muhammad and his Household,
with a blessing that will intercede for us
on the Day of Resurrection,
the day of neediness toward Thee!

57,Dua Istikhara,Supplication in Asking for the Best,"O God,
I ask from Thee the best in Thy knowledge,
so bless Muhammad and his Household
and decree for me the best!

Inspire us with knowledge to chose the best
and make that a means to
being pleased with what Thou hast decreed for us
and submitting to what Thou hast decided!
Banish from us the doubt of misgiving
and confirm us with the certainty of the sincere!

Visit us not with incapacity
to know what Thou hast chosen, lest we
despise Thy measuring out,
dislike the place of Thy good pleasure,
and incline toward that which is
further from good outcome
and nearer to the opposite of well-being!

Make us love what we dislike
in Thy decree
and make easy for us what we find difficult
in Thy decision!

Inspire us to yield
to that which Thou bringest upon us by Thy will,
lest we
love the delay of what Thou hast hastened
and the hastening of what Thou hast delayed,
dislike what Thou lovest,
and choose what Thou dislikest!

Seal us with that which is most praised in outcome

and appointed as a guardian over every book Thou hast sent down,2
preferring it over every narrative which Thou hast recounted,3

2- a separator, through which Thou hast separated
Thy lawful from Thy unlawful,4
a Qur'an, through which Thou hast made plain
the approaches to Thy ordinances,5
a book, which Thou hast distinguished very distinctly for Thy servants,6
a revelation, which Thou hast sent down,
a sending down, upon Thy prophet Muhammad7
(Thy blessings be upon him and his Household).

3- Thou appointed it
a light through following which we may be guided
from the shadows of error and ignorance,8
a healing for him who turns ear toward hearing it with the understanding of attestation,9
a just balance whose tongue does not incline away from truth,10
a light of guidance whose proof is not extinguished before the witnesses,11
and a guidepost of deliverance, so that
he who repairs straightway to its prescription
will not go astray
and he who clings to its preservation's handhold
will not be touched by the hands of disasters.

4- O God,
since Thou hast given us help to recite it
and made smooth the roughness of our tongues
through the beauty of its expression,
place us among those who
observe it as it should be observed,
serve Thee by adhering in submission
to the firm text of its verses,
and seek refuge in admitting both its ambiguous parts
and the elucidations of its clear signs!

5- O God, Thou sent it down upon Thy prophet Muhammad
(God bless him and his household) in summary form,
Thou inspired him with the science of its wonders to complement it,
Thou made us the heirs of its knowledge as interpreters,12
Thou made us to surpass him who is ignorant of its knowledge,
and Thou gave us strength over it
to raise us above those not able to carry it.

6- O God, just as Thou hast appointed our hearts
as its carriers
and made known to us through Thy mercy
its nobility and excellence,
so also bless Muhammad, its preacher,
and his Household, its guardians,
and place us among those who confess that it has come from Thee,
lest doubt about attesting to it assail us,
or deviation from its straightforward path shake us!

7- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and make us one of those who hold fast to its cord,
seek haven from its ambiguities in its fortified stronghold,
rest in the shadow of its wing,
find guidance in the brightness of its morning,
follow the shining of its disclosure,
acquire light from its lamp,
and beg not guidance from any other!

8- O God, just as through it Thou hast set up Muhammad
as a guidepost to point to Thee
and through his Household Thou hast made clear Thy good pleasure's roads to Thee,
so also bless Muhammad and his Household
and make the Qur'an our mediation to the noblest stations of Thy honour,
a ladder by which we may climb
to the place of safety,
a cause for our being repaid
with deliverance at the Plain of Resurrection,
and a means whereby we may reach
the bliss of the House of Permanence!

9- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
lessen for us through the Qur'an the weight of heavy sins,
give to us the excellent qualities of the pious,
and make us follow the tracks of those who stood before Thee
in the watches of the night and the ends of the day,13
such that Thou purifiest us from every defilement through its purification
and makest us to follow the tracks of those
who have taken illumination from its light
and whom expectation has not distracted from works,
cutting them off through its delusions' deceptions!

10- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and appoint the Qur'an
for us an intimate in the shadows of nights
and a guardian against the instigations of Satan
and confusing thoughts,
for our feet an obstruction from passing to acts of disobedience,
for our tongues a silencer without blight
preventing a plunge into falsehood,
for our limbs a restrainer from committing sins,
and for the scrutiny of heedfulness
rolled up in heedlessness an unroller,
such that Thou attachest to our hearts
the understanding of the Qur'an's wonders
and its restraining similitudes
which immovable mountains in all their solidity
were too weak to carry!14

11- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and through the Qur'an make permanent the rightness of our outward selves,
veil the ideas of confusing thoughts
from the soundness of our innermost minds,
wash away the dirt of our hearts and the ties of our heavy sins,
gather our scattered affairs,
quench the thirst of our burning heat in the standing place of the presentation to Thee,
and clothe us in the robes of security
on the Day of the Greatest Terror at our uprising!15

12- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and through the Qur'an redress our lack - our destitution in poverty -
drive toward us the comforts of life
and an abundance of plentiful provisions,
turn aside blameworthy character traits
and base moral qualities,
and preserve us from the pit of unbelief
and the motives for hypocrisy,
such that the Qur'an may be
for us at the resurrection a leader
to Thy good pleasure and Thy gardens,
for us in this world a protector against Thy displeasure and transgressing Thy bounds
and for what is with Thee a witness
by its declaring lawful the lawful
and its declaring unlawful the unlawful!

13- O God, bless Muhammad and his Household
and through the Qur'an make easy for our souls at death
the distress of the driving,16
the effort of the moaning,
and the succession of the rattling, when souls reach the throats
and it is said, 'Where is the enchanter?';17
when the angel of death discloses himself to seize them from behind the veils of unseen things,
letting loose at them from the bow of destinies
the arrows of the terror of lonesome separation,
and mixing for them from sudden death
a cup poisoned to the taste;
and when departure and release for the hereafter come close to us,
works become collars around the necks,18
and the graves become the haven
until the appointed time of the Day of Encounter!

14-O God, bless Muhammad and his Household,
make blessed for us the arrival at the house of decay
and the drawn out residence between the layers of the earth,
appoint the graves, after separation from this world, the best of our waystations,
make roomy for us through Thy mercy the narrowness of our tombs,
and disgrace us not among those present at the Resurrection through our ruinous sins!

15- Through the Qur'an
have mercy upon the lowliness of our station at the standing place of presentation to Thee,
make firm the slips of our feet during the shaking of the bridge across hell on the day of passage over it,
illuminate the darkness of our graves before the Uprising,
and deliver us from every distress on the Day of Resurrection
and from the hardships of terrors on the Day of Disaster!

16- Whiten our faces on the day when the faces of wrongdoers are blackened19
during the Day of Regret and Remorse,
appoint love for us in the breasts of the faithful,
and make not life for us troublesome!

17- O God, bless Muhammad, Thy servant and Thy messenger,
just as He delivered Thy message,
executed Thy command,
and counselled Thy servants!

18- O God, on the Day of Resurrection make our Prophet
(Thy blessings be upon him and his Household)
the nearest of the prophets to Thee in seat,
the ablest of them before Thee with intercession,
the greatest of them with Thee in measure,
and the most eminent of them with Thee in rank!

19- O God, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,
ennoble his edifice, magnify his proof,
make weighty his balance, accept his intercession,
bring near his mediation,20
whiten his face, complete his light, and raise his degree!

20- Make us live according to his Sunna,
make us die in his creed,
take us on his road, make us travel his path,
place us among the people who obey him,
muster us in his band, lead us to up his pool,21
and give us to drink of his cup!

21- And bless Muhammad and his Household,
with a blessing through which Thou wilt take him
to the most excellent of Thy good, Thy bounty, and Thy generosity for which he hopes!
Thou art Possessor of boundless mercy
and generous bounty.

22- O God, repay him for Thy messages which he delivered,
Thy signs which he passed on,
the good counsel he gave to Thy servants,
and the struggle he undertook in Thy way,
with the best Thou hast repaid any of Thy angels brought nigh
and Thy prophets sent out and chosen!
And upon him and his Household,
the good, the pure,
be peace, God's mercy, and His blessings!",by Imam Zain ul Abideen (as),دعاۓ ختم القرآن,دعاهای ختم قرآن,دعاء ختم القرآن,दुआ ख़त्मुल क़ुरआन,Dua Khatmul Quran,,,,

speedy and untiring,
frequenter of the mansions of determination,1
moving about in the sphere of governance!

illuminates jet-black shadows by thee,

and one of the marks of His authority,
and humbled thee through increase and decrease,
rising and setting, illumination and eclipse.
In all of this thou art obedient to Him,
prompt toward His will.

How wonderful is what He has arranged in thy situation!
How subtle what He has made for thy task!
He has made thee the key to a new month
for a new situation.

my Creator and thy Creator,
my Determiner and thy Determiner,
my Form-giver and thy Form-giver,
that He bless Muhammad and his Household
and appoint thee a crescent of blessings not effaced by days
and of purity not defiled by sins;

a crescent of auspiciousness containing no misfortune,
of prosperity accompanied by no adversity, of ease not mixed with difficulty,
of good unstained by evil;
a crescent of security and faith,
favour and good-doing, safety and submission!

6- O God,
bless Muhammad and his Household,
place us among the most satisfied of those over whom the crescent has risen,
the purest of those who have looked upon it,
the most fortunate of those who have worshipped Thee under it;
give us the success during [the new month] to repent,
preserve us within it from misdeeds,
guard us therein from pursuing disobedience to Thee,

7- allot to us within it thanksgiving for Thy favour,
clothe us during it in the shields of well-being,
and complete for us Thy kindness
by perfecting therein obedience to Thee!

My dreadful crimes have deadened my heart, so bring it to life by a repentance from Thee! O my hope and my aim! O my wish and my want! By Thy might, I find no one but Thee to forgive my sins and I see none but Thee to mend my brokenness! I have subjected myself to Thee in repeated turning, I have humbled myself to Thee in abasement.
If Thou castest me out from Thy door, in whom shall I take shelter? If Thou repellest me from Thy side, in whom shall I seek refuge? O my grief at my ignominy and disgrace! O my sorrow at my evil works and what I have committed! I ask Thee, O Forgiver of great sins, O Mender of broken bones, to overlook my ruinous misdeeds and cover my disgraceful secret thoughts! At the witnessing place of the Resurrection, empty me not of the coolness of Thy pardon and forgiveness, and strip me not of Thy beautiful forbearance and covering! My God, let the cloud of Thy mercy cast its shadow upon my sins and send the billow of Thy clemency flowing over my faults! My God, does the runaway servant go back but to his Master? Or does anyone grant sanctuary to him from His anger but He?
My God, if remorse for sins is a repentance, I by Thy might am one of the remorseful! If praying forgiveness for offenses is an alleviation, I am one of those who pray forgiveness! To Thee I return that Thou may be well pleased! My God, through Thy power over me, turn toward me, through Thy clemency toward me, pardon me, and through Thy knowledge of me, be gentle toward me! My God, Thou art He who hast opened a door to Thy pardon and named it 'repentance', for Thou said, Repent to God with unswerving repentance. What is the excuse of him who remains heedless of entering the door after its opening?
My God, though the sins of Thy servant are ugly, Thy pardon is beautiful. My God, I am not the first to have disobeyed Thee, and Thou turned toward him, or to have sought to attain Thy favour, and Thou wert munificent toward him. O Responder to the distressed! O Remover of injury! O Great in goodness! O Knower of everything secret! O Beautiful through covering over!

It takes me on the roads of disasters, it makes me the easiest of perishers before Thee; many its pretexts, drawn out its expectations; when evil touches it, it is anxious, when good touches it, grudging; inclining to sport and diversion, full of heedlessness and inattention, it hurries me to misdeeds and makes me delay repentance. My God, I complain to Thee of an enemy who misguides me and a satan who leads me astray. He has filled my breast with tempting thoughts, and his suggestions have encompassed my heart.
He supports caprice against me, embellishes for me the love of this world, and separates me from obedience and proximity! My God, to Thee I complain of a heart that is hard, turned this way and that by tempting thoughts, clothed in rust and the seal, and of an eye too indifferent to weep in fear of Thee and eagerly seeking that which gladdens it! My God, there is no force and no strength except in Thy power, and no deliverance for me from the detested things of this world save through Thy preservation. So I ask Thee by Thy far-reaching wisdom and Thy penetrating will not to let me expose myself to other than Thy munificence and not to turn me into a target for trials!

How could Thy generous face disappoint me?! Would that I knew Did my mother bear me for wretchedness? Did she nurture me for suffering? Would then that she had not borne me and had not nurtured me! Would that I had knowledge Hast Thou appointed me one of the people of felicity? Hast Thou singled me out for Thy nearness and neighbourhood? Then would my eyes be gladdened, and in that my soul reach serenity.

Dost Thou manacle hands which expectations have raised to Thee in hope of Thy clemency? Dost Thou punish bodies which worked to obey Thee until they grew thin in struggling for Thee? Dost Thou chastise legs which ran to worship Thee?

My God, who is the one who has come before Thee seeking hospitality, and whom Thou hast not received hospitably? Who is the one who has dismounted at Thy door hoping for magnanimity, and to whom Thou hast not shown it?
